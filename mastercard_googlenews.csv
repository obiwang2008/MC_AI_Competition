Please do your homework and let us know if you have any questions or concerns.Whether you‰Ûªre new to credit or trying to rebuild your credit after making some mistakes, you might find it impossible to get a credit card with amazing rewards and benefits.First Progress Mastercard secured credit cards can help you get there, though. They have no minimum credit requirements and reasonable interest rates. The only question is, which one should you choose? Find out how you can make your selection below.First Progress Mastercard credit cards reviewFor the most part, the three credit cards have the same features. The only differences are their interest rates and annual fees.Let‰Ûªs talk about some advantages and disadvantages the three secured credit cards share. Then, we‰Ûªll get into the details of each one.Pros Cons No minimum credit score required Annual fee Account activity reported to all three major credit bureaus Security deposit required Reasonable interest rates No rewardsFirst Progress Mastercard credit card optionsDepending on how you plan to use the card, you can choose between the following options (as of November 2017):: $29 annual fee and 19.99% APR: $39 annual fee and 13.99% APR: $49 annual fee and 9.99% APRWhat‰Ûªs more, if you qualify for one of the three secured credit cards, you automatically qualify for the other two as well.Each card requires that you put up a security deposit equal to the credit line you want. You can deposit as little as $200 or as much as $2,000 when you open the account.If you want to increase your credit limit after that, you can do so with the card issuer‰Ûªs approval and another deposit. The maximum credit limit you can acquire over time is $5,000.First Progress Mastercard interest rates and feesIn addition to the fees already covered, the First Progress Mastercard secured cards charge the following fees as of November 2017:Cash advance fee: $10 or 3 percent of the amount of the cash advance, whichever is greater$10 or 3 percent of the amount of the cash advance, whichever is greater Foreign transaction fee: 3 percent of the transaction amount3 percent of the transaction amount Late payment fee: Up to $38Up to $38 Returned payment fee: Up to $27You‰Ûªll also pay a higher interest rate on cash advances. Here are the cash advance APRs for each card as of November 2017:First Progress Platinum Elite: 24.99% APR24.99% APR First Progress Platinum Select: 19.99% APR19.99% APR First Progress Platinum Prestige: 18.99% APRKeep in mind that interest begins accruing on cash advances on the day of the transaction. There‰Ûªs no grace period like there is with regular purchases.First Progress Mastercard eligibility requirementsFirst Progress Mastercard secured cards don‰Ûªt have a minimum credit requirement. And there‰Ûªs no stated minimum income requirement on the website.That said, all credit card issuers are required by law to ensure that you can make the required payments before opening an account, so you do need to have some form of satisfactory income to get approved.First Progress Mastercard credit cards are available in all states except Arkansas, Iowa, New York, and Wisconsin. In most states, you can apply at age 18, but you must be 19 if you live in Alabama or Nebraska.In all states, you need a Social Security number to apply, unless otherwise specified.How to apply for a First Progress MastercardWhen you‰Ûªre ready to apply, you‰Ûªll need to share the following information:Full nameEmail addressHome addressPhone numberMonthly income and obligationsSecurity deposit amountSocial Security numberDate of birthThe application takes just a few minutes. Once you fill it out and agree to the First Progress Mastercard terms and conditions, you‰Ûªll enter your bank information to set up the deposit. Then, you‰Ûªll hit ‰ÛÏsubmit‰Ûù and get a response within a few moments.Once you‰Ûªve been approved and open an account, you can manage your card online. First Progress doesn‰Ûªt have a mobile app, however, so you can‰Ûªt manage things on the go.First Progress Mastercard customer serviceAs you might expect with a credit card with no bells or whistles, First Progress reviews are mixed. For example, the First Progress Mastercard Platinum Elite card has 3.6 out of five stars on WalletHub as of November 2017.Customers who are satisfied with First Progress appreciate its willingness to approve them when other credit card issuers won‰Ûªt (reviews edited for grammar and spelling):‰ÛÏSo far so good! Can‰Ûªt complain. They gave me a chance when others did not.‰Ûù ‰ÛÏThis is a pretty good entry-level credit card because the fees are low and the acceptance rate is high. I love that this card can be used anywhere! It makes it even easier to build up your poor credit back to a point where you can start applying for cards with larger limits. The bottom line is that if you have poor credit, this is a great card to start out with.‰ÛùIn contrast, some reviewers complained of high interest rates and bad experiences with customer service:‰ÛÏI will probably get rid of this card soon because of the high APR.‰Ûù ‰ÛÏI signed up, deposited my funds, and received the card. My only problem is I don‰Ûªt have the paperwork that came with the card to activate the card. Customer Service cannot help. First of all, they don‰Ûªt have [a] record of my account, and secondly, it‰Ûªs Turkey, so I can‰Ûªt speak with a live agent.‰ÛùIf you have any questions about First Progress Mastercard secured cards, you might run into some issues. Despite stating ‰ÛÏour goal is to help‰Ûù on its contact page, the only contact method it lists is a P.O. box.It‰Ûªs possible, however, that you‰Ûªll gain access to a phone number after you‰Ûªre approved.Which First Platinum Mastercard should you choose?If you‰Ûªre not sure which First Progress Mastercard secured card is right for you, consider how you plan to use the card.For example, if you‰Ûªll pay off your balance in full each month, it doesn‰Ûªt matter what your interest rate is. Go with the because is has the lowest annual fee.If, however, you think you‰Ûªll likely carry a balance, you‰Ûªll want the because it has the lowest interest rate.Shop other credit cardsFirst Progress Mastercard isn‰Ûªt the only credit card issuer that offers credit cards to people with bad credit. Here are a few other options to consider:Discover it Secured: It offers rewards, no annual fee, and a refundable security deposit.OpenSky Secured: It doesn‰Ûªt do a credit check and has a $35 annual fee.Capital One Secured: You can qualify to get a credit line higher than your initial deposit. Plus, there‰Ûªs no annual fee.As you‰Ûªre comparing different credit cards for bad credit, consider what features are most important to you.But also keep in mind that these cards aren‰Ûªt meant to be used indefinitely. They‰Ûªre stepping stones to help you improve your credit so you can qualify for better cards later on.Interested in refinancing student loans?Here are the top 6 lenders of 2018!","First Progress Mastercard secured credit cards can help you get there, though.First Progress Mastercard credit cards reviewFor the most part, the three credit cards have the same features.First Progress Mastercard eligibility requirementsFirst Progress Mastercard secured cards don‰Ûªt have a minimum credit requirement.First Progress Mastercard credit cards are available in all states except Arkansas, Iowa, New York, and Wisconsin.Shop other credit cardsFirst Progress Mastercard isn‰Ûªt the only credit card issuer that offers credit cards to people with bad credit.","['progress', 'card', 'interest', 'secured', 'annual', 'cards', 'review', 'fee', 'youll', 'credit', 'mastercard']",,,['Ben Luthi'],2018-01-23 01:54:00+00:00,https://studentloanhero.com/featured/first-progress-mastercard-secured-cards-build-credit-small-fee/,,,,

Mastercard Sets Deadline for Partners to Support Biometric Authentication,"Mastercard has set a deadline for its partners to implement biometric security for remote and mobile-based transactions: The company has announced that all of its customers must have access to fingerprint or facial recognition authentication by April of next year.For banks issuing Mastercard payment cards, that means they‰Ûªll need to enable such biometric security for online transactions, as well as transactions made at the point of sale using smartphones or other mobile devices.In a statement announcing the roadmap, Mastercard laid out the case for its biometric requirement on two main bases. One is that it improves the shopping experience: Citing a study conducted with Oxford University, Mastercard said that 93 percent of consumers prefer biometrics to passwords for payment validation; and the company asserted that ‰ÛÏcustomers are much more inclined to go through with their purchase‰Ûù when biometric authentication is used, asserting that order ‰ÛÏabandonment rates can drop by up to 70% compared to other methods like One Time Password sent via SMS‰Ûù.The other key basis for the roadmap is the implementation of new regulatory standards like the Strong Customer Authentication requirement in the European Union‰Ûªs new PSD2 regulations. Together with the proliferation of biometric authentication technologies on mobile devices, these factors ‰ÛÏsuggest that the time is ripe for enabling biometric validation solutions for digital payments,‰Ûù the company argued.Mastercard also framed the plan as part of its larger effort to bring biometric security into payments, citing its Mastercard Identity Check mobile app, developed in collaboration with Daon and its multimodal biometric authentication platform. And while Mastercard did not allude in its announcement to its more secretive preparations to launch biometric payment cards, its partner IDEX has been more forthcoming in suggesting that the company has high expectations for these solutions as well in the near future.‰ÛÒJanuary 23, 2018 ‰ÛÒ by Alex Perala","Mastercard has set a deadline for its partners to implement biometric security for remote and mobile-based transactions: The company has announced that all of its customers must have access to fingerprint or facial recognition authentication by April of next year.For banks issuing Mastercard payment cards, that means they‰Ûªll need to enable such biometric security for online transactions, as well as transactions made at the point of sale using smartphones or other mobile devices.In a statement announcing the roadmap, Mastercard laid out the case for its biometric requirement on two main bases.Together with the proliferation of biometric authentication technologies on mobile devices, these factors ‰ÛÏsuggest that the time is ripe for enabling biometric validation solutions for digital payments,‰Ûù the company argued.Mastercard also framed the plan as part of its larger effort to bring biometric security into payments, citing its Mastercard Identity Check mobile app, developed in collaboration with Daon and its multimodal biometric authentication platform.","['payment', 'biometric', 'deadline', 'validation', 'sets', 'authentication', 'transactions', 'partners', 'company', 'mobile', 'solutions', 'security', 'mastercard', 'support']",,,[],2018-01-23 16:04:30-04:00,https://findbiometrics.com/mastercard-biometric-authentication-deadline-501235/,,,,
Former Visa CEO Joins Cryptocurrency Startup Making Payment Cards,"More and more top brass from traditional financial companies is joining cryptocurrency startups. The latest is an ex-CEO of Visa UK and Ireland.‰Û÷SEAMLESS‰Ûª PAYMENTSThe former CEO of Visa UK and Ireland has joined a cryptocurrency startup looking to make cards for everyday shopping.Marc O‰ÛªBrien, CEO of Visa UK and Ireland from 2008 to 2014, was announced as CEO of cryptocurrency payments startup Crypterium on Thursday. Crypterium calls itself a ‰ÛÏcryptobank‰Ûù that lets you pay with tokens via NFC, QR codes or in online stores.The startup plans to partner with Visa and Mastercard to make cryptocurrency cards that charge your virtual wallet in ‰ÛÏa fraction of a second,‰Ûù he said in an interview with Business Insider.O‰ÛªBrien explained:That card will be attached to a wallet that we‰Ûªve created and every time the consumer makes a transaction we will receive a request for that transaction in our systems, we will check the bitcoin or ether account and provided that they‰Ûªve got sufficient balance we will execute a trade and mark their bitcoin balance for a trade and approve the transaction.It can sometimes take up to a week to exchange cryptocurrency into your bank account, but O‰ÛªBrien said the startup will speed up the process so people can make everyday purchases.‰ÛÏWhat Crypterium will do is make that whole process seamless and give an opportunity for a consumer to actually use their cryptocurrency to pay for everyday items,‰Ûù he said.O‰ÛªBrien claims Crypterium‰Ûªs ‰ÛÏsecret sauce‰Ûù intellectual property will protect transactions from the volatility of cryptocurrencies.The startup also has global ambitions. O‰ÛªBrien said Crypterium has a ‰ÛÏunique opportunity‰Ûù to appeal to consumers as a ‰ÛÏsafe haven‰Ûù in high-inflation markets such as Turkey and Argentina.‰ÛÏThe concern that many of them might have about getting access to that currency in a short space of time for immediate spending,‰Ûù he said, ‰ÛÏwe‰Ûªre going to be in a position to bridge that gap and make it an instant gratification,‰Ûù O‰ÛªBrien said.Crypterium currently has a team of three people in London and ten in Moscow and is considering offices in New York, Singapore, and Miami. He added that they plan to release their first products in autumn.But the startup faces competition in the space. Another payments company, Bitpay, already offers a Visa card that can be used in the United States. And Singapore-based startup TenX has created a virtual card to make cryptocurrency payments easy while traveling.FROM FINANCE TO CRYPTOCrypterium isn‰Ûªt the first crypto startup to poach former executives from traditional financial institutions. But an ex-JPMorgan trader turned cryptocurrency fund manager has gone so far to say banks ‰ÛÏhave absolutely failed to innovate‰Ûù when it comes to cryptocurrency.Daniel Masters, who ran JPMorgan‰Ûªs energy trading business in the 1990s, called cryptocurrency a ‰ÛÏtrue revolution‰Ûù and cast doubt on the willingness of conventional financial service companies to adopt it.From his interview in February with Business Insider:The analogue financial services companies are not in this game at all. They don‰Ûªt want to touch the core currency, which is Bitcoin or ethereum, they‰Ûªre suspicious about the industry itself. A lot of people think it‰Ûªs a criminal enterprise and a Ponzi scheme and a scam.What do you think of making cryptocurrency cards for everyday shopping?

Mastercard to verify payments by selfies or fingerprint scans from next year,"Mastercard users will be able to verify their identity using fingerprint scans or facial recognition when they pay for something online next year.The firm has told banks issuing Mastercard-branded debit and credit cards that they must be able to offer biometric authentication, such as fingerprint scans, when you pay for something online, over the phone, or by contactless payment on your mobile. This will be in addition to existing PIN and password verification.You'll be asked to confirm your identity by using your phone at the equivalent stage of a transaction when you are usually sent a one-time password to a mobile phone or email address, or are asked to type in your PIN.You'll be able to choose if you want to use facial recognition or fingerprint verification, and you'll still be able to authenticate payments by using passwords, but Mastercard says evidence suggests the vast majority of customers prefer biometrics.The company says the move will bring it in line with the EU's new requirements for 'strong customer authentication', which will be enforced from next year.See 30+ Ways to Stop Scams for how to stay safe online.What does Mastercard say?It's unclear exactly when the biometric authentication will be introduced by each bank, but Mastercard says it must be in place by April 2019.Mark Barnett, president of Mastercard UK and Ireland, said: ""Biometric technologies perfectly meet the public's expectation for state-of-the-art security when making a payment.""This will be of great benefit to everyone: consumers, retailers and banks. It will make the purchase much smoother, and instead of having to remember passwords to authenticate, shoppers will have the chance to use a fingerprint or a picture of themselves.""We also asked Visa and American Express if they were making any preparations for the new EU requirement.A Visa spokesperson said: ""Biometrics is an area that Visa has been involved in for many years, both through our own innovations and working with our partners such as Apple, Google and Samsung, who incorporate biometrics as part of their authentication. What's more, our view is that biometrics in payments isn't simply about mobile; indeed, we have recently launched the first commercial pilots of a biometric card for contactless payments.""We're still awaiting a response from Amex.Get Our Free Money Tips Email!

By something that only a customer possesses (eg, a card). By something unique to a customer (eg, a fingerprint).Although some banks already apply this process on a voluntary basis, for example, by making you use a card reader and entering a PIN when you use online banking, it is not currently compulsory, but the law will make it so.","Mastercard users will be able to verify their identity using fingerprint scans or facial recognition when they pay for something online next year.The company says the move will bring it in line with the EU's new requirements for 'strong customer authentication', which will be enforced from next year.It's unclear exactly when the biometric authentication will be introduced by each bank, but Mastercard says it must be in place by April 2019.Mark Barnett, president of Mastercard UK and Ireland, said: ""Biometric technologies perfectly meet the public's expectation for state-of-the-art security when making a payment.'Strong customer authentication' will be required under the EU's second Payment Services Directive å_ the same directive which banned all charges for paying on credit or debit card.","['using', 'customer', 'biometric', 'visa', 'selfies', 'authentication', 'scans', 'verify', 'payments', 'able', 'pin', 'fingerprint', 'mastercard', 'online']",,,"['Callum Mason', 'News Reporter']",2018-01-24 14:37:12+00:00,https://www.moneysavingexpert.com/news/cards/2018/01/mastercard-to-verify-payments-by-selfie-or-fingerprint-scan-from-next-year,,,,

Mastercard: Crypto Card Bans A Factor in Q1 Volume Decline,"Moves by major banks to ban their customers from using their payment cards to buy cryptocurrencies led to a dip in cross-border transaction volume during the first quarter of 2018, Mastercard's chief financial officer said Wednesday.Martina Hund-Mejean said that the company's cross-border payments volume rose 19 percent during the first part of 2018 overall ‰ÛÒ however, that volume was down 2 percent when compared to the last quarter of 2017 ""in part due to the drop [in] crypto wallet funding,"" she said, according to an earnings call transcript published by Seeking Alpha.She explained:""So the issue in this, first of all, in terms of the stacks, on the cross-border volume growth, the cryptocurrency funding or the crypto wallet funding really was 1 percent.

How Does the Fundamental Picture Look for Mastercard Incorporated (MA)? ‰ÛÒ Stock News Gazette,"Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) trade is getting exciting but lets take a deeper look whether it is as good a moment. Now trading with a market value of 200.43B, the company has a mix of catalysts and obstacles that spring from the nature of its operations. In light of the many issues surrounding this company, we thought it was a good time to take a close look at the numbers in order to form a realistic perspective on the fundamental picture for this stock.It‰Ûªs generally a good idea to start with the most fundamental piece of the picture: the balance sheet. The balance sheet health of any company plays a key role in its ability to meet its obligations and maintain the faith of its investment base. For MA, the company currently has 7.44 billion of cash on the books. The trend over time is important to note. In this case, the company‰Ûªs debt has been growing. The company also has 22.94 billion in total assets, balanced by 17.14 billion in total liabilities, which should give you a sense of the viability of the company under any number of imagined business contexts.Mastercard Incorporated (MA) saw 1.09 billion in free cash flow last quarter, representing a quarterly net change in cash of 973 million. Perhaps most importantly where cash movements are concerned, the company saw about 1.18 billion in net operating cash flow.As far as key trends that demonstrate something of the future investment potential of this stock, we need to take a closer look at the top line, first and foremost. Last quarter, the company saw 3.58 billion in total revenues. That represents a quarterly year/year change in revenues of 0.31 in sequential terms, the MA saw sales decline by 0.08.But what about the bottom line? After all, that‰Ûªs what really matters in the end. Mastercard Incorporated (MA) is intriguing when broken down to its core data. For shareholders, given the total diluted outstanding shares of 1.06 billion, this means overall earnings per share of 1.41. Note, this compares with a consensus analyst forecast of 1.71 in earnings per share for its next fiscal quarterly report.Looking ahead at valuations, according to the consensus, the next fiscal year is forecast to bring about 7.25 in total earnings per share. If we consider a median price to earnings ratio on the stock, that corresponds with a stock price of 25.55. However, one should always remember: the trends are more important than the forecasts. This continues to be an interesting story, and we look forward to updating it again soon on Mastercard Incorporated.","Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) trade is getting exciting but lets take a deeper look whether it is as good a moment.Mastercard Incorporated (MA) saw 1.09 billion in free cash flow last quarter, representing a quarterly net change in cash of 973 million.That represents a quarterly year/year change in revenues of 0.31 in sequential terms, the MA saw sales decline by 0.08.Mastercard Incorporated (MA) is intriguing when broken down to its core data.Looking ahead at valuations, according to the consensus, the next fiscal year is forecast to bring about 7.25 in total earnings per share.","['cash', 'stock', 'does', 'picture', 'incorporated', 'billion', 'total', 'company', 'gazette', 'ma', 'fundamental', 'saw', 'mastercard', 'earnings', 'look']",,,[],5/11/18 0:00,https://stocknewsgazette.com/2018/05/11/how-does-the-fundamental-picture-look-for-mastercard-incorporated-ma/,,,,
#RBTE2018: Mastercard on retail‰Ûªs big challenges and opportunities,"Mastercard SVP of business development Scott Abrahams believes three of the biggest trends in retail are the use and protection of data, the ‰Û÷conscious consumer‰Ûª and the importance of the customer journey.Speaking at RBTE 2018 Abrahams said a major trend to emerge will be the pooling of data for the mutual benefit of everyone.‰ÛÏWe believe the trend will be for more businesses to pool data in a secure manner that can be used for the greater good,‰Ûù he added said. ‰ÛÏWe believe the trend for pooling data for the multiplier effect will start to take off more and more.‰ÛùAbrahams explained that data is now at the top of consumers' minds with GDPR and the revelations about Facebook and Cambridge Analytica.The modern consumer is now also more likely to buy-in to companies that serve a greater good, according to Abrahams.‰ÛÏWe see consumers can become more engaged with businesses and marketing campaigns that have a cause at their heart more than just a special offer.‰ÛùThe final key trend facing retailers in the eyes of Abrahams is that ‰ÛÏcustomers want to interact with you in a way of their choosing and not the way of your choosing.‰ÛùThis is being driven by innovative companies such as Uber, Deliveroo and Amazon.Mastercard believes that in the next few years almost half (47%) of transactions will be digital.Abrahams concluded: ‰ÛÏConsumers expectations of a store are changing ‰ÛÒ Sweaty Betty runs yoga classes in its stores.‰ÛÏShopping is clearly a leisure activity and now the leisure activity is widening within those stores themselves.‰Ûù","Speaking at RBTE 2018 Abrahams said a major trend to emerge will be the pooling of data for the mutual benefit of everyone.‰ÛÏWe believe the trend will be for more businesses to pool data in a secure manner that can be used for the greater good,‰Ûù he added said.The modern consumer is now also more likely to buy-in to companies that serve a greater good, according to Abrahams.Abrahams concluded: ‰ÛÏConsumers expectations of a store are changing ‰ÛÒ Sweaty Betty runs yoga classes in its stores.‰ÛÏShopping is clearly a leisure activity and now the leisure activity is widening within those stores themselves.‰Ûù","['leisure', 'good', 'data', 'mastercard', 'opportunities', 'rbte2018', 'pooling', 'abrahams', 'consumer', 'challenges', 'consumers', 'trend', 'retails', 'big', 'way', 'greater']",,,['Matthew Chapman'],5/3/18 13:11,https://www.essentialretail.com/news/rbte2018-mastercard-challenges/,,,,
Critical Comparison: Western Digital Corporation (WDC) vs. Mastercard Incorporated (MA) ‰ÛÒ Stock News Gazette,"Western Digital Corporation (NASDAQ:WDC) shares are up more than 11.28% this year and recently increased 0.72% or $0.63 to settle at $88.50. Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), on the other hand, is up 27.50% year to date as of 05/23/2018. It currently trades at $192.99 and has returned 0.32% during the past week.Western Digital Corporation (NASDAQ:WDC) and Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) are the two most active stocks in the Data Storage Devices industry based on today‰Ûªs trading volumes. To determine if one is a better investment than the other, we will compare the two companies‰Ûª growth, profitability, risk, return, and valuation characteristics, as well as their analyst ratings and sentiment signals.The ability to grow earnings at a compound rate over time is a crucial determinant of investment value. Analysts expect WDC to grow earnings at a 21.67% annual rate over the next 5 years. Comparatively, MA is expected to grow at a 21.48% annual rate. All else equal, WDC‰Ûªs higher growth rate would imply a greater potential for capital appreciation.Growth in and of itself is not necessarily valuable, and it can even be harmful to shareholders if companies overinvest in unprofitable projects in pursuit of that growth. We will use EBITDA margin and Return on Investment (ROI), which adjust for differences in capital structure, as measure of profitability and return. , compared to an EBITDA margin of 24.04% for Mastercard Incorporated (MA). WDC‰Ûªs ROI is 6.40% while MA has a ROI of 44.00%. The interpretation is that MA‰Ûªs business generates a higher return on investment than WDC‰Ûªs.The value of a stock is simply the present value of its future free cash flows. WDC‰Ûªs free cash flow (‰ÛÏFCF‰Ûù) per share for the trailing twelve months was +2.12. Comparatively, MA‰Ûªs free cash flow per share was +0.79. On a percent-of-sales basis, WDC‰Ûªs free cash flow was 3.32% while MA converted 6.6% of its revenues into cash flow. This means that, for a given level of sales, MA is able to generate more free cash flow for investors.Liquidity and leverage ratios are important because they reveal the financial health of a company. WDC has a current ratio of 2.40 compared to 1.60 for MA. This means that WDC can more easily cover its most immediate liabilities over the next twelve months. WDC‰Ûªs debt-to-equity ratio is 0.99 versus a D/E of 1.13 for MA. MA is therefore the more solvent of the two companies, and has lower financial risk.WDC trades at a forward P/E of 6.54, a P/B of 2.33, and a P/S of 1.32, compared to a forward P/E of 26.11, a P/B of 35.54, and a P/S of 15.18 for MA. WDC is the cheaper of the two stocks on an earnings, book value and sales basis. Given that earnings are what matter most to investors, analysts tend to place a greater weight on the P/E.Analyst Price Targets and OpinionsWhen investing it‰Ûªs crucial to distinguish between price and value. As Warren Buffet said, ‰ÛÏprice is what you pay, value is what you get‰Ûù. WDC is currently priced at a -24.71% to its one-year price target of 117.54. Comparatively, MA is -1.58% relative to its price target of 196.09. This suggests that WDC is the better investment over the next year.Risk and VolatilityAnalyst use beta to measure a stock‰Ûªs volatility relative to the overall market. Stocks with a beta above 1 tend to have bigger swings in price than the market as a whole, the opposite being the case for stocks with a beta below 1. WDC has a beta of 1.04 and MA‰Ûªs beta is 1.18. WDC‰Ûªs shares are therefore the less volatile of the two stocks.The analysis of insider buying and selling trends can be extended to the aggregate level. Short interest, which represents the percentage of a stock‰Ûªs tradable shares currently being shorted, captures what the market as a whole feels about a stock. WDC has a short ratio of 1.49 compared to a short interest of 1.77 for MA. This implies that the market is currently less bearish on the outlook for WDC.Western Digital Corporation (NASDAQ:WDC) beats Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) on a total of 10 of the 14 factors compared between the two stocks. WDC is growing fastly, has higher cash flow per share, higher liquidity and has lower financial risk. In terms of valuation, WDC is the cheaper of the two stocks on an earnings, book value and sales basis, WDC is more undervalued relative to its price target. Finally, WDC has better sentiment signals based on short interest.","The ability to grow earnings at a compound rate over time is a crucial determinant of investment value.WDC‰Ûªs free cash flow (‰ÛÏFCF‰Ûù) per share for the trailing twelve months was +2.12.Comparatively, MA‰Ûªs free cash flow per share was +0.79.On a percent-of-sales basis, WDC‰Ûªs free cash flow was 3.32% while MA converted 6.6% of its revenues into cash flow.This means that, for a given level of sales, MA is able to generate more free cash flow for investors.","['cash', 'flow', 'stock', 'wdcs', 'wdc', 'digital', 'price', 'critical', 'incorporated', 'free', 'gazette', 'ma', 'investment', 'stocks', 'western', 'mastercard', 'value', 'vs']",,,[],5/24/18 0:00,https://www.stocknewsgazette.com/2018/05/24/critical-comparison-western-digital-corporation-wdc-vs-mastercard-incorporated-ma/,,,,
"Top Stock Reports for Mastercard, NVIDIA & Danaher","Monday, May 14, 2018The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Mastercard (MA), NVIDIA (NVDA) and Danaher (DHR). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today‰Ûªs research reports here >>>Strong-Buy ranked Mastercard‰Ûªs shares have increased 63.6% over the last year, significantly outperforming the Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry‰Ûªs gain of 37.4% during the same period. Mastercard‰Ûªs earnings beat expectations and surged 43% year over year. Better-than-expected results were primarily backed by higher switched transactions, increase in cross-border volume and gross dollar volume as well as gains from acquisitions.The Zacks analyst thinks the company is well placed for growth, given its solid market position, ongoing expansion and digital initiatives plus significant opportunities from the secular shift toward electronic payments. The buyouts of VocaLink and NuData Security complement the company‰Ûªs efforts to participate in new payment flows and enhance its safety and security offerings.The stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings being revised upward over the last 30 days. However, escalating costs continue to bother. Also, higher incentives and rewards will put pressure on its bottom line.(You can read the full research report on Mastercard here >>> ).Shares of NVIDIA have surged in the last one year, gaining +89.5% versus the Zacks General Semiconductor industry‰Ûªs +57.4% gain, thanks to the company‰Ûªs positive record of earnings surprises in the recent quarters. NVIDIA posted a stellar first quarter and provided encouraging second-quarter fiscal 2019 revenue guidance.Also, the company registered year-over-year growth on both the counts, primarily stemming from growth across all four platforms. Also, higher-than-anticipated demand for its gaming chips helped drive the encouraging results. Furthermore, the Zacks analyst thinks NVIDIA‰Ûªs innovative product pipeline and strength in gaming and high-end notebook GPUs keep it well positioned.Higher adoption of NVIDIA‰Ûªs Volta processors is also likely to act as a catalyst in the near term. Nevertheless, a recent development like suspension of test drives for all its driverless vehicles and likely sluggish demand from cryptocurrency miners leads to caution about its near-term performance.(You can read the full research report on NVIDIA here >>> ).Buy-ranked Danaher‰Ûªs shares have gained +10.1% over the past six months, outperforming the Zacks Diversified Operations industry, which has declined -5.5% over the same period. Danaher‰Ûªs first-quarter 2018 adjusted earnings beat expectations by 6.5% and improved 16.5% year over year.The company‰Ûªs core revenue growth, margin expansion and earnings growth during the reported quarter came on the back of its operating culture DBS. The Zacks analyst is optimistic about the company‰Ûªs core revenue and earnings growth, on the back of improving order trends and rising healthcare spending. Its recent acquisitions ‰ÛÒ Pall and Cepheid ‰ÛÒ are proving to be strong profit churners, and will boost core revenues in the quarters ahead.This apart, the company‰Ûªs continuous introduction of products enables it to penetrate new markets and gain competitive edge in existing ones. However, sluggish economic conditions across some key operating regions and unfavorable currency translations pose as significant headwinds.(You can read the full research report on Danaher here >>> ).Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Occidental Petroleum (OXY), Automatic Data Processing (ADP) and Altria (MO).5 Medical Stocks to Buy NowZacks names 5 companies poised to ride a medical breakthrough that is targeting cures for leukemia, AIDS, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, and other conditions.New products in this field are already generating substantial revenue and even more wondrous treatments are in the pipeline.

Pulse Labs' Goal: Smarter Virtual Assistants,"Consumers are increasingly comfortable chatting with their robot friends. A quick glance at the PYMNTS/Visa How We Will Pay survey indicated that a growing segment of consumers are already pursuing connected commerce experiences through a variety of devices and interfaces and are highly enthusiastic about doing so more frequently as the technology advances.But those improvements are still rather avidly awaited, because voice technology has a tendency to go wrong, often in amusing ways.One particularly scared Twitter user, for example, noted Alexa seemed to be carrying on a romance with the Google Assistant in their kitchen.Although Google and Alexa are apparently surprisingly good at talking to each other, the most common complaint is that they‰Ûªre not particularly good at talking to real people sometimes. One user asked Alexa to turn out the living room lights, which Alexa interpreted as a request play Bon Jovi‰Ûªs 1986 classic ‰ÛÏLivin‰Ûª On A Prayer‰Ûù as a lullaby.Another noted that when she asked Alexa to turn on her porch light, Alexa informed her she could not follow that request ‰ÛÓ because the user didn‰Ûªt own a Porsche.And while it might be easy ‰ÛÓ if perhaps a bit pointless ‰ÛÓ to get mad at Alexa, it really isn‰Ûªt fair. Human beings are harder to talk to, particularly if you happen to be a machine, noted Pulse Labs Co-Founder and CEO Abhishek Suthan.‰ÛÏPeople come from different backgrounds, cultures and languages, and what‰Ûªs colloquial in one place means something totally different someplace else. Building those experiences, keeping the user in mind and making that experience personalized enough for them is the holy grail, which is what we‰Ûªre trying to build,‰Ûù Suthan said.Artificial intelligence (AI), he noted, often grows ‰ÛÏupside down‰Ûù in this regard ‰ÛÓ with design being pegged around macro-use, instead of being personalized to an individual user.It‰Ûªs a mistake, Suthan said ‰ÛÓ one Pulse Labs hopes to improve by teaching AIs how to converse better with those who want to talk to them.Building a Better Conversation PartnerPulse Labs connects mobile app developers to app users ‰ÛÓ specifically users in the demographic group the voice app is targeting, allowing them to test drive talking to the app before it launches. Developers get data on what prompts work, which ones fall flat and what ‰ÛÏunexpected‰Ûù situations come up in the interactive journey.The tiny firm ‰ÛÓ three people as of right now ‰ÛÓ got its start in the first ever Alexa Accelerator, and the company recently raked in $2.5 million in seed funding to begin building out its vision.

Mastercard Introduces Biometrics Mandate,"Sometimes eCommerce retailers need to verify a customer‰Ûªs identity at checkout, but the authentication process often leads to lost sales. Methods like a one-time password sent by text message (SMS), for example, can cause many consumers to abandon their online shopping carts.Customers are more inclined to go through with a purchase when retailers use alternate authentication methods. Abandonment rates can drop by up to 70 percent when retailers offer biometric verification instead, according to an announcement from Mastercard.In combination with the impending rollout of PSD2 in the European Union that will allow external third parties to access customers‰Ûª bank accounts with their permission, Mastercard announced earlier this week (Jan. 23) that its issuers must offer biometric identification to its account holders by April 2019.Mastercard‰Ûªs EMEA Lead, Identity Solutions, Michael Sass told PYMNT‰Ûªs Karen Webster that the company did not take the decision lightly. ‰ÛÏIt was a bold move, and we thought long and hard about it, but we felt that the regulation ‰ÛÓ the PSD2 RTS [Regulatory Technical Standards] ‰ÛÓ would require most eCommerce transactions to be authenticated,‰Ûù Sass said.While currently only a quarter of eCommerce transactions require authentication today, Sass said that percentage will double or triple once RTS kicks in. If the same abandonment rates are applied to increased eCommerce volume, merchants could miss out on a significant amount of lost revenue.Not a New ConceptBiometric authentication is not an entirely new concept, with financial institutions already implementing this technology into their software. ‰ÛÏMany banks already provide biometric authentication for their online banking apps,‰Ûù Sass said. ‰ÛÏAnd there [are] more and more devices supporting biometric authentication and more of our customers are using it.‰ÛùIn the U.K., for example, 27 percent of smartphones have a fingerprint sensor. And 70 percent of consumers there use the feature when it‰Ûªs available on their phones.‰ÛÏIt‰Ûªs not yet on every device, but when it‰Ûªs there ‰Û_ the vast majority use it, which really highlights that customers feel comfortable using fingerprint and biometric authentication,‰Ûù Sass said, adding that Mastercard has seen similar adoption rates when banks offer Touch ID for opening a banking app. ‰ÛÏIt shows you that the market is ripe for adopting biometric authentication.‰ÛùMastercard offers biometric identification through Mastercard Identity Check in 37 countries, which enables individuals to use biometric identifiers, such as fingerprint, iris and facial recognition, to verify their identities when using a mobile device for online shopping and banking.Research shows that 93 percent of consumers prefer using biometrics over passwords for authenticating payments, while 92 percent of banking professionals say they want to utilize it.Yet not all consumers have access to a smartphone that provides this technology ‰ÛÓ or even a smartphone at all ‰ÛÓ so Mastercard is asking banks to support another authentication method in addition to biometric verification, such as a passcode.Time Is RightAs the European Union embraces adoption of PSD2 ‰ÛÓ and RTS ‰ÛÓ Mastercard believes the rule will be likely published in March, with its effective date in Sept. 2019. And once PSD2 and RTS are live, banks may need to make some changes.‰ÛÏBanks will need to think about how to comply, which for many will mean changing their existing authentication method, because many still use static passwords, for example,‰Ûù Sass said.The technology is also becoming more widespread ‰ÛÓ and accurate. Before 2017, that false-positive rate for Touch ID ‰ÛÓ or the equivalent on Android phones ‰ÛÓ was at one in 50,000. But, with the advent of iris scanning and FaceID, those odds have improved dramatically: Their false-positive rate is one in a million, ‰ÛÏwhich is quite low,‰Ûù Sass said.‰ÛÏThat‰Ûªs a significant improvement, and I [would] personally not be surprised if we have similar improvements in the coming years,‰Ûù Sass said. ‰ÛÏMaybe not all in 2018, but I‰Ûªm sure in 2019, 2020, there‰Ûªll probably be a wave of new, exciting, biometric technologies.","Sometimes eCommerce retailers need to verify a customer‰Ûªs identity at checkout, but the authentication process often leads to lost sales.Abandonment rates can drop by up to 70 percent when retailers offer biometric verification instead, according to an announcement from Mastercard.‰ÛÏMany banks already provide biometric authentication for their online banking apps,‰Ûù Sass said.Research shows that 93 percent of consumers prefer using biometrics over passwords for authenticating payments, while 92 percent of banking professionals say they want to utilize it.Time Is RightAs the European Union embraces adoption of PSD2 ‰ÛÓ and RTS ‰ÛÓ Mastercard believes the rule will be likely published in March, with its effective date in Sept. 2019.","['biometric', 'ecommerce', 'customers', 'mandate', 'authentication', 'introduces', 'psd2', 'rts', 'consumers', 'biometrics', 'using', 'sass', 'mastercard']",,,[],2018-01-26 15:50:48+00:00,https://www.pymnts.com/mastercard/2018/biometric-authentication-facial-recognition/,,,,

Mastercard and US Bank to pilot connected car payments,"Mastercard and US Bank to pilot connected car paymentsSource: MastercardToday, company car drivers have to manually enter in their driver ID and odometer reading every time they use a fleet card to pay at the pump.

Visa Stock Is a Better Value Than Mastercard,"Visa has a more attractive valuation than Mastercard, Bank of America analyst Jason Kupferberg says. (Getty Images)So far in 2018, Visa Inc (NYSE: V) stock hasn't been able to keep pace with shares of rival Mastercard Inc (MA). However, Mastercard's run may soon be coming to an end, making Visa the smarter choice for long-term investors.Mastercard stock has surged 18.4 percent year-to-date, more than doubling Visa's 7.3 percent gain. According to Bank of America analyst Jason Kupferberg, the earnings valuation gap between Mastercard and Visa is the largest it has been in nearly five years, suggesting Visa may soon be playing catch-up.Kupferberg says Mastercard will maintain its slight competitive advantage over Visa in 2018 and beyond, but it's not enough to justify a 10 percent forward price-earnings premium.""We view the current discount as extended in the context of more similar growth rates for V and MA beyond 2018 (ie, consensus EPS growth for 2019 is just slightly higher for MA), and note the last time Visa traded at such a significant discount to MA was the result of unexpected regulatory/legal developments rather than fundamental business performance,"" Kupferberg says.He says investors shouldn't expect Visa to match Mastercard's revenue growth simply due to Visa's larger scale. Visa reported roughly 50 percent more total revenue than Mastercard in 2017.At this point, however, Kupferberg says Visa has a more attractive valuation and Mastercard's revenue growth will likely peak in the first quarter of 2018.""While the consensus preference has shifted significantly to MA over the past six months, we prefer V modestly over MA,"" he says.CFRA analyst Scott Kessler is a bit more cautious on Visa at the moment. Kessler says electronic, digital and mobile payment fundamentals look appealing, but Visa Europe remains a wild card.""We think the June 2016 acquisition of Visa Europe made sense for V, as the potential cost savings and earning accretion have been clearly outlined,"" Kessler says. ""However, we believe the purchase, completed days before the Brexit leave vote, added some risk related to European currencies and economic growth.""Kessler says Visa's exposure to China is also a risk given the potential for an economic slowdown.Bank of America has a ""buy"" rating and $140 price target for Visa.

A Closer Look At MasterCard's 2017,"MasterCard ( MA ) has had a fairly strong 2017, as the company managed to grow its revenue, net of client incentives, by 15% in the first 9 months of the year, and its stock price has gained nearly 44% since the beginning of the year. The company's core performance continues to be strong, about in line with our expectations. The company posted strong growth across all divisions, with transaction processing fees in the U.S. growing at 19% through the third quarter. The only downside for the company was that client incentives and rebates grew faster than overall revenue growth at 21%. These trends are similar to what we witnessed in the previous quarters and in line with our expectations for the company.MasterCard's expenses grew at the same pace as revenues, meaning that the company's operating margin stayed just about flat. Going forward, we expect MasterCard's expenditures on sales and marketing, and client incentives to grow at a slower pace, especially as it integrates the capabilities of NuData Security into its software suite. According to a U.S. Payments survey conducted last year , 74% of customers would prefer to use a service that is more secure than one that offered more benefits. Credit card customers are increasingly preferring security and ease of use over reward points, and the company's focus in this direction can have a significant impact on the bottom line, as well as helping to grow its transaction volumes both in the U.S. and internationally. Its gross dollar volume ( GDV ) of processed transactions grew at 10% in the U.S., while cross border volumes grew at 14% on a local currency basis.MasterCard remains in an extremely strong position overall. It is focused on increasing the revenue from transactions processed on its network in the U.S. as well as internationally. This can be achieved through a few routes:Increasing the number of MasterCard issued cards in circulation: As an increasing number of international merchants accept credit and debit cards, and more international customers shift from cash to card transactions, we expect that volumes will grow substantially.As an increasing number of international merchants accept credit and debit cards, and more international customers shift from cash to card transactions, we expect that volumes will grow substantially. Increasing the number of devices through which payments can be made: Recent developments in mobile phone payment technology are expected to increase the reach of financial institutions across the world. The global volume of money spent using mobile phones is expected to grow to over $1 trillion by 2019. Almost 166 million users are expected to use NFC technology by 2018. By 2021, NFC or other contactless technologies are projected to generate close to $190 billion in transaction value.Recent developments in mobile phone payment technology are expected to increase the reach of financial institutions across the world.

Increasing the spend per customer through increasing ease of use, security, reward points, and size of co-branding network : Recent deals with American Airlines, Bed Bath & Beyond, and PayPal in the U.S., Walmart in Canada and China, Axis Bank in India, and Amadeus (an international travel company) will help MasterCard on this front.

Mastercard and Cinkciarz trademark dispute grinds on,"Source: CinkiarzCinkciarz.pl wins against MasterCard. The company refuted MasterCard's objections against the registration of the Cinkciarz.pl company trademarks. In Europe alone Cinkciarz.pl has won every one of the 12 proceedings in which a decision has been made.MasterCard objected to the registration of overlapping circles in the word-graphic trademarks consisting of logo of Cinkciarz.pl. The objections alleged that the graphic design was similar to a series of former MasterCard trademarks registered for identical or similar products and services.‰ÛÏIn Europe alone, MasterCard filed objections to 13 trademark applications for registration of Cinkciarz.pl‰Ûªs word-graphic trademarks. So far, the Office of the European Union for Intellectual Property (EUIPO) in Alicante, Spain, which conducts these proceedings, has rejected 12 of MasterCard‰Ûªs oppositions and issued favourable verdicts to Cinkciarz.pl,‰Ûù says Professor Ewa Skrzydlo-Tefelska from Soltysinski Kawecki & Szlezak's law firm in Warsaw, Cinkciarz.pl's attorney.One case has been temporarily suspended. The other decisions are not yet binding. MasterCard has the option of lodging an appeal within two months of issuance.Moreover, cases are also ongoing outside Europe. MasterCard filed objections to the international protection of Conotoxia‰Ûªs word-graphic trademarks in Australia and the United States. Additionally, it objected to the protection of the CINKCIARZ trademarks in the United States.

"Choosing Between Hot Stocks: Visa Inc. (V), Mastercard Incorporated (MA) ‰ÛÒ Stock News Gazette","The shares of Visa Inc. have increased by more than 13.37% this year alone. The shares recently went up by 0.86% or $1.1 and now trades at $129.26. The shares of Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), has jumped by 24.93% year to date as of 05/07/2018. The shares currently trade at $189.10 and have been able to report a change of 6.08% over the past one week.The stock of Visa Inc. and Mastercard Incorporated were two of the most active stocks on Monday. Investors seem to be very interested in what happens to the stocks of these two companies but do investors favor one over the other? We will analyze the growth, profitability, risk, valuation, and insider trends of both companies and see which one investors prefer.When a company is able to grow consistently in terms of earnings at a high compound rate have the highest likelihood of creating value for its shareholders over time. Analysts have predicted that V will grow it‰Ûªs earning at a 18.06% annual rate in the next 5 years. This is in contrast to MA which will have a positive growth at a 21.48% annual rate. This means that the higher growth rate of MA implies a greater potential for capital appreciation over the years.Growth alone cannot be used to see if the company will be valuable. Shareholders will be the losers if a company invest in ventures that aren‰Ûªt profitable enough to support upbeat growth. In order for us to accurately measure profitability and return, we will be using the EBITDA margin and Return on Investment (ROI), which balances the difference in capital structure. V has an EBITDA margin of 70.48%, this implies that the underlying business of V is more profitable. The ROI of V is 15.70% while that of MA is 44.00%. These figures suggest that MA ventures generate a higher ROI than that of V.The value of a stock is ultimately determined by the amount of cash flow that the investors have available. Over the last 12 months, V‰Ûªs free cash flow per share is a positive 10.13, while that of MA is positive 6.64.The ability of a company to meet up with its short-term obligations and be able to clear its longer-term debts is measured using Liquidity and leverage ratios. The current ratio for V is 1.90 and that of MA is 1.60. This implies that it is easier for V to cover its immediate obligations over the next 12 months than MA. The debt ratio of V is 0.58 compared to 1.13 for MA. MA can be able to settle its long-term debts and thus is a lower financial risk than V.V currently trades at a forward P/E of 24.55, a P/B of 10.16, and a P/S of 14.86 while MA trades at a forward P/E of 25.64, a P/B of 34.83, and a P/S of 14.71. This means that looking at the earnings, book values and sales basis, V is the cheaper one. It is very obvious that earnings are the most important factors to investors, thus analysts are most likely to place their bet on the P/E.The mistake some people make is that they think a cheap stock has more value to it. In order to know the value of a stock, there is need to compare its current price to its likely trading price in the future. The price of V is currently at a -7.73% to its one-year price target of 140.09. Looking at its rival pricing, MA is at a -3.56% relative to its price target of 196.09.When looking at the investment recommendation on say a scale of 1 to 5 (1 being a strong buy, 3 a hold, and 5 a sell), V is given a 1.80 while 1.70 placed for MA. This means that analysts are more bullish on the outlook for V stocks.Short interest or otherwise called the percentage of a stock‰Ûªs tradable shares currently being shorted is another data that investors use to get a handle on sentiment. The short ratio for V is 3.13 while that of MA is just 1.75. This means that analysts are more bullish on the forecast for MA stock.ConclusionThe stock of Mastercard Incorporated defeats that of Visa Inc. when the two are compared, with MA taking 5 out of the total factors that were been considered. MA happens to be more profitable, generates a higher ROI, has higher cash flow per share, higher liquidity and has a lower financial risk. When looking at the stock valuation, MA is the cheaper one on an earnings, book value and sales basis.

Jobs thought to be safe as Mastercard announces changes at Irish unit,"Mastercard has announced a major restructuring that directly impacts its fintech-focused research and development centre in Ireland, which employs more than 200 people. However, it is believed there will be no job losses as a result of the move.If anything, it is thought the decision to merge the company‰Ûªs physical and digital payments team under one organisation may lead to the creation of more roles in Dublin.The restructuring, which comes into effect in early April, coincides with the departure of Garry Lyons, who set-up Mastercard Labs here in 2012.Mr Lyons, who previously led Orbiscom, is leaving Mastercard to establish a new venture, although the company stressed he will remain an advisor to its management committee, while the new venture is to provide services to his former employer.‰ÛÏI‰Ûªm excited for this next chapter in my career,‰Ûù said Mr Lyons, who was chief innovation officer with the payments giant.‰ÛÏI‰Ûªm equally delighted to embark on this journey with Mastercard as a partner as we create new services for our customers,‰Ûù he added.Mr Lyons joined Mastercard following its $100 million acquisition of Dublin-based electronics payment software firm Orbiscom in December 2008.It is believed his former employer has offered financial backing for his new start-up.‰ÛÏGarry has helped us to think differently about the payment experience, using those sparks to deliver additional value to customers and consumers,‰Ûù said Ajay Banga, president and chief executive officer, Mastercard.‰ÛÏI‰Ûªm looking forward to the opportunities his new venture will create for our company, both as a customer and as an investor.

Better Buy: American Express Company vs. Mastercard,"Many investors think of the major credit card brands as similar companies, but this isn't the case. Payment processors such as Mastercard (NYSE:MA) have a business model that is significantly different than credit card issuers like American Express (NYSE:AXP). Here's a rundown of the similarities and differences between these two companies' business models and which could be the better buy now.Payment processors versus credit card issuersMastercard's primary business model is payment processing. The company doesn't itself issue credit cards -- instead, it serves as a middleman between consumers, businesses, and banks. A consumer swipes a credit card at a business, and the bank that issued the credit card sends a payment to the business. Mastercard's payment network facilitates these transactions. It makes most of its money from ""swipe fees,"" which are charged to merchants when a customer pays with a Mastercard-branded credit or debit card.On the other hand, American Express is a ""closed-loop"" payment network. Put another way, American Express is both the middleman and the bank. When an American Express card is swiped, American Express is the lender that sends money to the merchant and bills the consumer.Because of this, not only does American Express make money from swipe fees, but it also earns interest income from outstanding consumer balances, as well as fee income from the annual fees charged to cardholders.Growth and future potentialMastercard has delivered pretty impressive growth numbers recently. Its third-quarter results showed a 18% revenue increase and a 24% rise in EPS over the past year on impressive growth in transaction volume. The company also has several pathways to future growth, such as in its overseas business and with new payments technologies, in which it has invested heavily in recent years.American Express, on the other hand, has done an excellent job of getting past the loss of its Costco partnership, although its growth hasn't been quite as impressive as Mastercard's. Revenue grew at 9%, half the rate of Mastercard, although EPS grew by 25%.However, there is just as much long-term growth potential as Mastercard has, especially if the company decides to aggressively pursue international markets. Visa and Mastercard are widely accepted in many international markets, while American Express is not. After all, there are more than four times as many Mastercard-branded cards than Amex cards in circulation.ValuationMastercard clearly has the edge when it comes to growth. However, you'll pay a significant premium for it. As you can see in the chart below, American Express is the cheaper of the two, by a significant margin.Company Recent Stock Price TTM Earnings Price-to-Earnings Ratio Mastercard $151.57 $4.29 35.3 American Express $94.55 $5.18 18.3Which is the better buy now?Both of these companies are rock-solid payment processing giants, and I don't think investors will go wrong with either stock over the long run. Globally, electronic payments make up just over 10% of transactions, so there's no shortage of opportunity for both of these companies to grow tremendously over time.Having said that, I would buy American Express now, and in full disclosure, I already own shares in my portfolio. At about half the valuation of Mastercard and strong long-term growth potential, I think the risk-reward simply makes more sense. And as a closed-loop payment network, American Express is in a position to expand its profits as interest rates rise. While I'm certainly a Mastercard bull, and I applaud the company's aggressive investment strategy into financial technologies, American Express looks like the better value right now.","Here's a rundown of the similarities and differences between these two companies' business models and which could be the better buy now.When an American Express card is swiped, American Express is the lender that sends money to the merchant and bills the consumer.As you can see in the chart below, American Express is the cheaper of the two, by a significant margin.Company Recent Stock Price TTM Earnings Price-to-Earnings Ratio Mastercard $151.57 $4.29 35.3 American Express $94.55 $5.18 18.3Which is the better buy now?Having said that, I would buy American Express now, and in full disclosure, I already own shares in my portfolio.","['card', 'think', 'business', 'express', 'credit', 'american', 'companies', 'buy', 'company', 'better', 'growth', 'vs', 'mastercard', 'payment']",,,"['Matthew Frankel', 'Matt Brought His Love Of Teaching', 'Investing To The Fool In In Order To Help People Invest Better.

"For Mastercard Incorporated (MA), It May Be As Good A Moment ‰ÛÒ Stock News Gazette","Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) is one of the more popular stocks investors are adding into their watchlist. Now trading with a market value of 201.04B, the company has a mix of catalysts and obstacles that spring from the nature of its operations. As the day-to-day narrative ebbs and flows for this company, it is more important than ever to step back and get a bird‰Ûªs eye view of the fundamental reality under the surface of this story.It‰Ûªs generally a good idea to start with the most fundamental piece of the picture: the balance sheet. The balance sheet health of any company plays a key role in its ability to meet its obligations and maintain the faith of its investment base. For MA, the company currently has 7.44 billion of cash on the books. The trend over time is important to note. In this case, the company‰Ûªs debt has been growing. The company also has 22.94 billion in total assets, balanced by 17.14 billion in total liabilities, which should give you a sense of the viability of the company under any number of imagined business contexts.Mastercard Incorporated (MA) saw 1.09 billion in free cash flow last quarter, representing a quarterly net change in cash of 973 million. Perhaps most importantly where cash movements are concerned, the company saw about 1.18 billion in net operating cash flow.As far as key trends that demonstrate something of the future investment potential of this stock, we need to take a closer look at the top line, first and foremost. Last quarter, the company saw 3.58 billion in total revenues. That represents a quarterly year/year change in revenues of 0.31 in sequential terms, the MA saw sales decline by 0.08.But what about the bottom line? After all, that‰Ûªs what really matters in the end. Mastercard Incorporated (MA) is intriguing when broken down to its core data. For shareholders, given the total diluted outstanding shares of 1.06 billion, this means overall earnings per share of 1.41. Note, this compares with a consensus analyst forecast of 1.71 in earnings per share for its next fiscal quarterly report.Looking ahead at valuations, according to the consensus, the next fiscal year is forecast to bring about 7.25 in total earnings per share. If we consider a median price to earnings ratio on the stock, that corresponds with a stock price of 25.73. However, one should always remember: the trends are more important than the forecasts. This continues to be an interesting story, and we look forward to updating it again soon on Mastercard Incorporated.","Mastercard Incorporated (MA) saw 1.09 billion in free cash flow last quarter, representing a quarterly net change in cash of 973 million.Perhaps most importantly where cash movements are concerned, the company saw about 1.18 billion in net operating cash flow.That represents a quarterly year/year change in revenues of 0.31 in sequential terms, the MA saw sales decline by 0.08.Mastercard Incorporated (MA) is intriguing when broken down to its core data.If we consider a median price to earnings ratio on the stock, that corresponds with a stock price of 25.73.","['cash', 'stock', 'good', 'incorporated', 'moment', 'billion', 'total', 'company', 'gazette', 'ma', 'share', 'mastercard', 'earnings', 'saw']",,,[],5/23/18 0:00,https://stocknewsgazette.com/2018/05/23/for-mastercard-incorporated-ma-it-may-be-as-good-a-moment/,,,,

How Will MasterCard Perform In The Next 3 Years?,"MasterCard ( MA ) has performed strongly over the past few years. Its revenue has grown at a CAGR of 13% and its stock price tripled since 2013. MasterCard continues to be focused on expanding its network of co-branding partners and improving technology to compete in the rapidly growing online payments segment. Recent deals with PayPal, Bank of America, Santander and Banque Travelex, among others, should help the company continue growing at a strong rate going forward. Credit card customers increasingly prioritize security and ease of use over reward points, and the company's focus in this direction as it integrates the capabilities of NuData Security suggests an improved growth outlook. We expect MasterCard's expenditures on sales and marketing, and client incentives to grow slower, and consequently drive operating margins.Our price estimate for MasterCard's stock stands at $150 , which is below the market price. We have also created an interactive dashboard which shows the forecast trends; you can modify the key value drivers to see how they impact the company's revenues and bottom line.Transaction revenue accounts for about a third of MasterCard's overall revenues. The company has seen significant growth in its transaction volumes, supported by the transition towards digital payments and MasterCard's expansion. The company's focus on improving technology to enhance payments and securitize the process should further help it expand its customer base and co-branding partners, and consequently drive growth in volumes and revenues.International transaction fees account for 23% of the overall revenue. With the recovery in global economic conditions, we expect improved consumer spending and international adoption of credit cards. Additionally, the company's expansion in developing markets should drive international GDV and revenue by around 6% annually.Assessments account for 28% of overall revenues. Growth in MasterCard's U.S. Gross Dollar Volume, driven by the improvement in the U.S. economy and consumer sentiment, should help drive MasterCard's assessment revenue by 7% annually.What's behind Trefis?

Hamilton Bulldogs win key game at 2018 Mastercard Memorial Cup,"The Hamilton Bulldogs have improved to a record of two wins and one loss at the 2018 Mastercard Memorial Cup in Regina, Saskatchewan. On Tuesday, the Bulldogs defeated the Acadie-Bathurst Titan 3-2 in their final round robin game of the 2018 Canadian junior ice hockey club championship tournament.Three Bulldogs recorded multi-point games. Robert Thomas of Aurora, Ontario and Benjamin Gleason each had one goal and one assist for two points and Brandon Saigeon of Grimsby, Ontario had two assists. The other Bulldogs goal scorer was Nicholas Caamano of Ancaster, Ontario.The Bulldogs can clinch first place on Wednesday with a Swift Current Broncos win over the Regina Pats. With the win over the Titan, the Bulldogs guaranteed at least a spot in the semifinal and will not have to play in Thursday‰Ûªs tiebreaker because they cannot be caught by the Broncos and Pats. The Broncos will play the Pats again on Thursday if they beat them Wednesday to close out the round robin.The Titan can still clinch first place if the Pats defeat the Broncos. In that scenario, there will not be a tiebreaker at all and Regina will play Hamilton in the semifinal on Friday with the winner to play Acadie-Bathurst on Sunday in the final.","The Hamilton Bulldogs have improved to a record of two wins and one loss at the 2018 Mastercard Memorial Cup in Regina, Saskatchewan.On Tuesday, the Bulldogs defeated the Acadie-Bathurst Titan 3-2 in their final round robin game of the 2018 Canadian junior ice hockey club championship tournament.The Bulldogs can clinch first place on Wednesday with a Swift Current Broncos win over the Regina Pats.The Broncos will play the Pats again on Thursday if they beat them Wednesday to close out the round robin.In that scenario, there will not be a tiebreaker at all and Regina will play Hamilton in the semifinal on Friday with the winner to play Acadie-Bathurst on Sunday in the final.","['regina', 'cup', 'key', 'tiebreaker', 'mastercard', '2018', 'semifinal', 'win', 'play', 'titan', 'broncos', 'round', 'bulldogs', 'hamilton', 'pats', 'memorial', 'game']",,,['Jeremy Freeborn'],2018-05-23 22:51:57+00:00,https://canadiansportscene.com/hamilton-bulldogs-win-key-game-at-2018-mastercard-memorial-cup/,,,,

Banks Adopt Military-Style Tactics to Fight Cybercrime,"Alfred F. Kelly Jr., Visa‰Ûªs chief executive, is ‰ÛÏcompletely paranoid‰Ûù about the subject, he told investors at a conference in March.

Moynihan said his cybersecurity team is ‰ÛÏthe only place in the company that doesn‰Ûªt have a budget constraint.‰Ûù (The bank‰Ûªs chief operations and technology officer said it is spending about $600 million this year.)The military sharpens soldiers‰Ûª skills with large-scale combat drills like Jade Helm and Foal Eagle, which send troops into the field to test their tactics and weaponry. The financial sector created its own version: Quantum Dawn, a biennial simulation of a catastrophic cyberstrike.In the latest exercise last November, 900 participants from 50 banks, regulators and law enforcement agencies role-played their response to an industrywide infestation of malicious malware that first corrupted, and then entirely blocked, all outgoing payments from the banks. Throughout the two-day test, the organizers lobbed in new threats every few hours, like denial-of-service attacks that knocked the banks‰Ûª websites offline.The first Quantum Dawn, back in 2011, was a lower-key gathering. Participants huddled in a conference room to talk through a mock attack that shut down stock trading. Now, it‰Ûªs a live-fire drill. Each bank spends months in advance re-creating its internal technology on an isolated test network, a so-called cyber range, so that its employees can fight with their actual tools and software. The company that runs their virtual battlefield, SimSpace, is a Defense Department contractor.Sometimes, the tests expose important gaps.A series of smaller cyber drills coordinated by the Treasury Department, called the Hamilton Series, raised an alarm three years ago. An attack on Sony, attributed to North Korea, had recently exposed sensitive company emails and data, and, in its wake, demolished huge swaths of Sony‰Ûªs internet network.If something similar happened at a bank, especially a smaller one, regulators asked, would it be able to recover?

3 Signs Visa and Mastercard's Best Days Are Ahead,"As the two largest credit card network operators, Visa (NYSE:V) and Mastercard (NYSE:MA) dominate the global payments industry.Yet with their stocks up 740% and 660%, respectively, over the past decade, you could be excused for thinking their days of turbocharged growth are behind them.You could also be quite wrong to think that.Here are three reasons to believe that tremendous gains still lie ahead for these payments titans.1. The staggering possibilities of e-commerceEven after two decades of torrid growth, the rise of e-commerce is still in its early innings. Online sales comprise only about 10% of the global retail total, and research firm eMarketer estimates that retail e-commerce sales will increase from $2.3 trillion in 2017 to nearly $4.5 trillion in 2021. With hundreds of millions of new people gaining access to the internet every year, e-commerce appears set to keep growing at a rapid pace for at least another decade, and likely much longer.Why is the growth of e-commerce beneficial to Visa and Mastercard? The answer is simple: Online sales are far more likely to be completed via digital payment methods than in-store transactions. In fact, Visa CFO Vasant Prabhu recently said that for online purchases, ""the propensity to use a Visa card is twice as high as a face-to-face transaction."" So as retail sales continue to trend online, Visa and Mastercard stand to profit handsomely.2. Massive -- and largely untapped -- market opportunitiesAnother area where these companies are expanding is in the business-to-business payments arena. This is a $124 trillion market, according to Mastercard CFO Martina Hund-Mejean, and one in which more than 80% of the transactions are currently completed via ACH, check, or cash.Both recently announced new B2B platforms, which they believe will allow them to capture a larger share of this immense opportunity. Mastercard's B2B Hub offers small and midsized businesses automation tools for digital invoice processing and accounts payable management that ""improve the speed, ease, and security"" of their commercial payments. Meanwhile, Visa's B2B offering, the Visa Ready Program for Business Solutions, helps companies quickly integrate an array of Visa B2B payments solutions, including ""enhanced data, virtual card integration, payables automation, and payment controls.""By offering tools to small businesses that were previously only available to larger enterprises, Mastercard and Visa should be able to rapidly advance their beachhead in B2B payments.3. Widening the moatAcquisitions are helping the rivals accelerate their growth in these high potential markets, as well as strengthen their competitive advantages over rivals.Mastercard's recent acquisition of VocaLink gave it the ability to offer business customers immediate bank account-based payments, known as Fast ACH. ACH is an electronic payments network that is commonly used for applications like direct deposits and payroll. This is a huge market -- more than 25 billion payments and $43 trillion in value were transferred via ACH in 2016 -- that is separate from Mastercard's core credit card network. Moreover, it can now offer prospective clients a holistic payments solution, including credit, debit, and ACH -- a value proposition that should help Mastercard continue to win new deals.Visa has also been on the hunt for acquisitions. In fact, the credit card giant is still digesting its $23 billion purchase of its former subsidiary, Visa Europe. The deal reunited the companies and added more than 500 million card accounts and $1.5 trillion in payments volume to Visa's network. The merger has been a boon for Visa's business, one that should continue to reward shareholders for many years to come.","As the two largest credit card network operators, Visa (NYSE:V) and Mastercard (NYSE:MA) dominate the global payments industry.The answer is simple: Online sales are far more likely to be completed via digital payment methods than in-store transactions.In fact, Visa CFO Vasant Prabhu recently said that for online purchases, ""the propensity to use a Visa card is twice as high as a face-to-face transaction.""So as retail sales continue to trend online, Visa and Mastercard stand to profit handsomely.Meanwhile, Visa's B2B offering, the Visa Ready Program for Business Solutions, helps companies quickly integrate an array of Visa B2B payments solutions, including ""enhanced data, virtual card integration, payables automation, and payment controls.""","['best', 'card', 'visa', 'b2b', 'online', 'ahead', 'payments', 'ach', 'trillion', 'mastercards', 'network', 'mastercard', 'days', 'signs', 'sales']",,,"['Joe Tenebruso', 'Joe Honed His Investing Skills As An Analyst For Stock Advisor', 'Fool One', 'Supernova', 'Million Dollar Portfolio', 'Income Investor.

Asda scraps å£99 petrol station deposit charge after complaints,"Image copyright Getty ImagesAsda has suspended a controversial å£99 petrol pump deposit trial after an outcry from customers.Those using pay-at-the-pump facilities at certain petrol stations were debited å£99 on top of their fuel purchase.Asda said the deposit was a holding charge to ensure customers had enough money to pay for their fuel.But following the backlash, Asda said it would ""suspend"" the scheme pending review because ""we always want to do the right thing for our customers"".One customer, Jade Louise, took to Facebook when she saw a å£99 debit on her online bank after topping up at the weekend.But the money never left her account, according to the supermarket and banks.The trial was introduced at three petrol stations to assess if it would help cut down fraud and stop people inadvertently going into the red.The deposit is intended to be cancelled as soon as the correct value is paid.However, Asda said the scheme requires coordination between MasterCard and Visa and customers' banks. Some banks are not able to comply, the supermarket said.In a statement, Asda said: ""The intention of Visa and MasterCard in this trial was to ensure customers had sufficient funds in their account to pay for their fuel, and the å£99 would be immediately released back to customers by their bank.""Whilst we have received very few complaints about this process, until we can be given assurance that all banks are able to comply with the Visa and MasterCard rule change, we cannot continue to implement this change and risk harming our customers' trust in us.""Change in the rulesMastercard told the BBC that a change in industry rules last year meant that petrol stations with automated fuel pumps were required to pre-authorise a value equivalent to a full tank of fuel.Image copyright Jade Louise Image caption Jade Louise says she won't be using pay-at-the-pump for a while.Previously, motorists had just å£1 taken from their accounts as a pre-authorisation to confirm that their card was valid.Ms Louise got a shock when she viewed her online statement after buying å£5 worth of petrol at Asda in Dewsbury over the Bank Holiday weekend.She used the pay-at-the-pump system which allows motorists to buy petrol without having to go into a kiosk.""All I wanted to do was top up my almost full tank, because having two children, you never know when you'll need it,"" she told the BBC.So when she saw the å£99 pending transaction on her account, she took to Facebook to warn others of the charge.""They should have notices on the petrol pumps making customers aware of this .... absolute joke!!!"", she wrote.She said she is happy Asda has stopped the trials ""because they haven't thought carefully enough about what could go wrong and how it could negatively impact their customers"".""I won't be using pay at the pump fuel stations for the foreseeable future."" One solution, she says, is: ""Bring back manned stations and give people work.""You may also like:","Image copyright Getty ImagesAsda has suspended a controversial å£99 petrol pump deposit trial after an outcry from customers.Those using pay-at-the-pump facilities at certain petrol stations were debited å£99 on top of their fuel purchase.Asda said the deposit was a holding charge to ensure customers had enough money to pay for their fuel.The trial was introduced at three petrol stations to assess if it would help cut down fraud and stop people inadvertently going into the red.""I won't be using pay at the pump fuel stations for the foreseeable future.""","['deposit', 'fuel', 'visa', 'petrol', 'stations', 'customers', 'louise', 'scraps', 'complaints', 'station', 'asda', 'trial', '99', 'using', 'charge']",,,[],,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-44062476,,,,
Mastercard Unveils AR Retail Experience at Money 20/20,"Mastercard has unveiled an augmented reality ‰ÛÏretail shopping experience‰Ûù that uses iris authentication to make for a more simplified and secure payment transaction.The technology is being presented at the Money 20/20 show in Las Vegas this week. Separately, the company has launched a solution aimed at helping consumers keep track of their digital credit ‰ÛÏfootprint‰Ûù and card details.The AR initiative is prototype technology developed ‰ÛÏas a proof of concept,‰Ûù Mastercard said, adding that the Saks Fifth Avenue ‰ÛÏbrand, marks and likeness‰Ûù is being used to showcase the shopping environment.Mastercard teamed up with Osterhout Design Group and Qualcomm Inc. to allow the company‰Ûªs Masterpass and Identity Check Mobile platforms to be used with iris authentication in an AR environment. The technology ‰ÛÏdelivers photo-realistic augmented reality and provides consumers the ultimate customized, security-focused shopping experience,‰Ûù Mastercard said in a statement.Sherri Haymond, executive vice president of digital partnerships at Mastercard, said the company is ‰ÛÏseeing major shifts in how commerce is conducted, as people lead increasingly connected, digital lifestyles. As the physical and digital worlds blend together, we are focused on developing solutions that provide merchants with the ability to accept payments across all technology platforms possible ‰ÛÓ in-store, in-app, online, and in AR and VR ‰ÛÓ to help drive how people will experience shopping and payments in the future.‰ÛùMastercard noted that AR has the potential to ‰ÛÏreshape the retail environment, making it more immersive and efficient.‰Ûù The company said the AR retail experience will not only ‰ÛÏlet shoppers view digital representations of products before they commit to a purchase, but also learn more about what they are buying, see additional options not available in the physical location and get instant recommendations or other information relevant to their unique experience.‰ÛùOnce participants are done with their shopping, they can pay for items using Masterpass. Authentication is done via iris recognition technology from Qualcomm. ‰ÛÏThe shopper then selects a card from their Masterpass-enabled wallet and completes the purchase by selecting the Masterpass button on the screen,‰Ûù the company said, adding that items can ‰ÛÏbe taken home from the store or shipped, depending on availability.‰ÛùThe company said the prototype was created so that it ‰ÛÏmay help retailers find new ways of enhancing the in-store shopping experience and generating incremental sales by sharing relevant content and information to the shopper while they are shopping.‰ÛùSeparately, Mastercard released ‰ÛÏMastercard Consumer Control,‰Ûù which allows users to keep track of where their digital card credentials are stored. ‰ÛÏThe solution provides consumers a central view of where their cards are stored across all digital channels, as well as the ability to control how, when and where those cards are used,‰Ûù the company said.Jessica Turner, executive vice president of digital payments and labs at Mastercard, said as digital payments continue to evolve, ‰ÛÏcardholders have more and more options to enable new types of devices for payment, and to pay in new ways online and in-app. In our ongoing commitment to deliver consumer-centric solutions, Mastercard is introducing a series of APIs that will give the consumer direct control to view where their card is stored and manage spend across all digital channels ‰ÛÓ all from right within their mobile banking app or web site.‰Ûù","Mastercard has unveiled an augmented reality ‰ÛÏretail shopping experience‰Ûù that uses iris authentication to make for a more simplified and secure payment transaction.The technology is being presented at the Money 20/20 show in Las Vegas this week.Separately, the company has launched a solution aimed at helping consumers keep track of their digital credit ‰ÛÏfootprint‰Ûù and card details.The technology ‰ÛÏdelivers photo-realistic augmented reality and provides consumers the ultimate customized, security-focused shopping experience,‰Ûù Mastercard said in a statement.Jessica Turner, executive vice president of digital payments and labs at Mastercard, said as digital payments continue to evolve, ‰ÛÏcardholders have more and more options to enable new types of devices for payment, and to pay in new ways online and in-app.","['card', 'unveils', 'retail', 'digital', 'shopping', 'technology', '2020', 'experience', 'payments', 'company', 'view', 'ar', 'money', 'mastercard']",,,"['Arthur Zaczkiewicz', 'Joelle Diderich', 'Jennifer Weil', 'Katya Foreman']",2017-10-23 14:00:35+00:00,http://wwd.com/business-news/technology/mastercard-ar-retail-experience-11032939/,,,,

Mastercard On Key 2017 Milestones In Payments,"While everyone is looking ahead to 2018, it‰Ûªs worth a look back at some of the major payments milestones of 2017. For Michael Miebach, chief product officer at Mastercard, those milestones include key acquisitions and partnerships that propelled the spread of real-time payments, use of application program interfaces (APIs) and advancement of payments security. The year was shaped by a redefinition of choice in how consumers and businesses use their money, says Miebach, and continued progress in 2018 will rely on innovation and collaboration. He shares his thoughts below.As the calendar turns to a new year, several lists and ‰ÛÏbest of‰Ûù articles are often published across a number of outlets. It‰Ûªs important to take stock and celebrate milestones. These moments also give us an opportunity to look ahead and think about how these efforts will set the stage for the coming year.So, in looking back at 2017, I‰Ûªm focused on what was a breakthrough and what went beyond the status quo. This year, technological breakthroughs ‰ÛÓ combined with new acquisitions and partnerships ‰ÛÓ have enabled us to redefine what‰Ûªs possible in payments. At Mastercard, we are building to a future in which simplicity, experience and seamlessness are paramount.When Worlds ConvergeToday‰Ûªs world requires a new way of thinking about how people interact and how they transact. No one will wake up in the morning thinking about how they want to make a payment that day. They simply are looking to make the purchases that will help add to their experiences or deliver on a goal.That‰Ûªs driving us to think about the physical and digital experience as part of a single, seamless, unified experience, whether in-store or online. Consumers and businesses alike are thinking beyond a plastic card, and that‰Ûªs what has driven our efforts to deliver the best products regardless of the form that account may take.Our acquisition of Vocalink helps us to be a stronger partner in delivering greater innovation and choice in payments. With bank- and card-based payments under one roof, we‰Ûªre delivering more efficient alternatives to cash and checks for individuals, businesses and governments, and providing more real-time payment options for more people in more places.The multiple rails of Mastercard and Vocalink are driven by great teams, great technology and a proven track record. It‰Ûªs this strong foundation that will enable access across a unified network of networks.Whether it‰Ûªs the peer-to-peer (P2P), business-to-consumer (B2C) or business-to-business (B2B) opportunity, our customers and clients have the ability to start a different conversation. It‰Ûªs truly about allowing people and businesses to access and use their money how they want. It‰Ûªs about connecting more senders with more receivers in more ways. For us, this redefinition of choice is enabling us to power real-time payments in the U.K., Thailand, Singapore and now the U.S. as The Clearing House (TCH) has gone live.Seamless AccessTechnology, and the proliferation of data, is also requiring a reset of how businesses collaborate. One-way, static flows of technology and information are no longer sufficient for the always-on business environment.It should be no surprise, then, that 2017 saw a continued proliferation of APIs and their use in payments. Gone are the days when APIs would allow different parts of a business to speak and collaborate with each other. APIs are now helping to enable seamless integration at all levels, between businesses and across all forms of payment.In order to breakthrough, companies will need to look beyond their own walls. That‰Ûªs why we have and continue to collaborate with both established players and startups. Each party brings a different perspective to allow us to stay ahead of the innovation curve and maximize the experiences brought about through connected devices.Enabling customers to integrate our technology seamlessly is essential to helping them deliver the best product and experience to the end cardholder or merchant.Through our API platform, we‰Ûªre providing access to more than 60 proprietary payments, data and security products and services, including a newly released API that delivers access to our blockchain technology. While just one example, it reinforces our continued appreciation of ‰ÛÓ and prioritization on ‰ÛÓ partnership.Embracing Security, Demanding SimplicityWe have said it often, but it cannot be said enough: Security can‰Ûªt be an afterthought, but it also cannot be about creating an impenetrable wall. Trust is built by considering both security and convenience as equally important aspects of innovation. We must be both far-reaching and nimble, smart and simple in how we manage safety and security.At Mastercard, we are building multiple layers of security to protect every transaction every transaction across thousands of issuers, millions of merchants and billions of purchases made by our cardholders. This complements our efforts to ensure common standards that deliver a common foundation of security, and peace of mind across geographies and form factors.2017 saw a number of new technologies come together to advance how we secure our network and our cardholders. We‰Ûªre embedding behavioral analytics, machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) across our network to continually screen for risks and stop catastrophic fraud in its tracks. We continued putting people in control of their information, providing choice and delivering a universal and consistent experience. Mastercard Identity Check made Selfie Pay a reality and emerging technologies like biometrics and AI will help deliver digital identities that people can trust.Looking ahead, Brighterion‰Ûªs SmartAgent AI software and NuData‰Ûªs behavioral biometrics technologies will help us vastly enhance authorization. These technologies verify identity in exciting new ways without inconveniencing the cardholder.The potential of payments was redefined in 2017 as siloes fell away and new technologies brought people, players and possibilities together. The future opportunity lies in defining the next innovation and collaboration that will help make businesses more efficient and life more convenient.","While everyone is looking ahead to 2018, it‰Ûªs worth a look back at some of the major payments milestones of 2017.For Michael Miebach, chief product officer at Mastercard, those milestones include key acquisitions and partnerships that propelled the spread of real-time payments, use of application program interfaces (APIs) and advancement of payments security.It should be no surprise, then, that 2017 saw a continued proliferation of APIs and their use in payments.Mastercard Identity Check made Selfie Pay a reality and emerging technologies like biometrics and AI will help deliver digital identities that people can trust.The potential of payments was redefined in 2017 as siloes fell away and new technologies brought people, players and possibilities together.","['businesses', '2017', 'key', 'help', 'innovation', 'milestones', 'payments', 'technology', 'deliver', 'technologies', 'experience', 'mastercard', 'security']",,,[],2017-12-29 04:15:14+00:00,https://www.pymnts.com/news/merchant-innovation/2017/mastercard-2017-payments-milestones/,,,,

"Mastercard, Unilever Launch Micro SMB Credit","Mastercard is expanding its existing partnership with Unilever to bridge micro-small business owners in Africa with access to financing.The payments technology company said this week that it will begin the initiative with consumer goods company Unilever in Kenya, which uses distribution data from Unilever and analysis from Mastercard to analyze inventory trends of businesses that procure from Unilever. That analysis will then be used to provide an eligibility recommendation to Kenya Commercial Bank to offer micro-financing to those businesses in the form of credit lines, the firms explained.According to Mastercard and Unilever, the initiative addresses a key challenge for banks that traditionally need formal credit history or collateral in order to extend credit; micro-businesses often lack these qualifications, forcing them into the shadow lending industry, high interest rates and a ‰ÛÏcycle of debt,‰Ûù the companies said.Approved micro-credit lines will allow small businesses (SMBs) in Kenya to procure more products without limitations of cash-on-hand.‰ÛÏMicro- and small businesses are the economic backbone of communities around the world,‰Ûù said Mastercard President and CEO Ajay Banga in a statement. ‰ÛÏThere‰Ûªs an opportunity to set these businesses up for long-term growth by bringing together the tools and data from different industries to change the model of small business financing.

"MasterCard, Visa gift cards can add sneaky tip","Have any Visa or MasterCard gift cards left over from the holiday season, or perhaps from your birthday?You might want to think twice before you use them at a restaurant, or at a hair or nail salon.CLICK HERE to see the YouTube video version of this reportAn Anderson Township woman learned they have a little secret that can be costly.""I am not going to buy another MasterCard gift card,"" Sandi Hannig said.Hannig said she wrote to MasterCard and asked the company to change its policy that lets it hit you with a surprise when using one of their gift cards.Card denied at cash registerIt happened to her at a hair salon. Hannig said when her hair was done, she went up to the counter and pulled out her MasterCard gift card, which she knew had enough money on it to cover the haircut.But there, in front of everyone -- managers and customers -- her card was declined.""Its very embarrassing if you've got a good card and they say 'oh no we can't process it,'"" she said. ""When I got home I called MasterCard, and they said they put a block on money on there of 20 percent for salons and restaurants.Common with prepaid gift cardsSo what's this secret charge? It's actually not a charge, though it can sure appear that way.It's something called ""tip tolerance"" according to LowCards.com, which says that Mastercard, Visa and American Express all do this with prepaid gift cards to ensure you have enough money to pay a tip.The 20% is actually just a hold on your card, and the money is placed back on the card within a few hours. The same thing happens when you use a card like this to pump gas: the issuer may put a $75 or $100 hold on your card, to make sure you have enough money to pay for gas.A MasterCard spokeswoman, Beth Kitchener, told WCPO:""There are some purchases that the final cost cannot be determined at the start of the sale. A hold is put on a certain percentage of the purchase to ensure the gift card holder doesn't spend more than the card value.""Unfortunately, Hannig's card was insufficient to cover both her bill and tip.""It sounds like you are trying to cheat them, and say I have more money on the card than I do,"" Hannig said. ""But the card was brand new.""Sandi Hannig said she wants to see the policy changed.""I am not opposed to tipping,"" she said, ""but I don't think its the job of MasterCard to make sure the restaurant or salon gets a tip.""Whatever you think of it, this is good to know about so you don't waste your money.CLICK HERE to see the YouTube video version of this report.___________________""Don't Waste Your Money"" is a registered trademark of Scripps Media, Inc.

Behind The Scenes With Mastercard CMO During Power-Packed NY Advertising Week,"Today may kick off the last day of New York Advertising Week, but the after effects from insights shared by many prominent figures in the business world will reverberate long after the annual event. A veritable back-to-back offering of panels, workshops and events taking place simultaneously throughout various locations in Manhattan, this conference is in its 14th year. Thought-leadership during the event comes from an impressive mash-up of notable names from the media, marketing, tech and celebrity worlds. CMO and CEO talks are, quite naturally, big tickets. But to get the audience of a CMO right before he takes the stage, is an even bigger ticket. Raja Rajamannar is a key figure in the world of global brands. Overseeing the 1.7 billion customer base that is Mastercard, Rajamannar shares insights and thoughts, separate from his public talk, on a disruptive new world full of data, politics/social issues, and marketing.Lauren deLisa Coleman: Rajas, today everyone is talking about data, but there is so much of it that many companies are either having a hard time defining how best to mine it and/or even more are struggling with which data to best analyze. Given the amount of data to which you have access, how are you handling it at Mastercard?Raja Rajamannar: First, it‰Ûªs helpful to keep in mind that Mastercard is and always has been a technology company. We are the technology behind so very many of the financial transactions that take place globally every day, so data is huge for us. The first step is always to know what you are trying to accomplish. For us, the task at hand could be trying to solve for an increased market share for the company or how to tap into our target audience more genuinely. Whatever it is, we start with the goal.LdC: So how are you looking at consumers, then, once you have the goal well-defined?RR: We don‰Ûªt do consumer studies anymore. That‰Ûªs over and should be over for all businesses. Consuming or making a purchase is only a small part of human behavior. So we look at overall human truths, such as what do individuals want now or what do specific groups want. This approach, for example, is what helped us to develop our ‰ÛÏPriceless Causes‰Ûù initiative because we saw that more and more people are genuinely interested in social good and philanthropy but in order to actually act upon it, need to be presented with the right moment. So through such things as a donation platform that can be accessed via the app or through our commitment as a company to give a certain percentage of purchases back to charity, we were able to give $40 million dollars to Stand Up To Cancer, and this has enabled 2 new drugs to be discovered.LdC: But how are you actually analyzing the data that enables you to look at cultural trends, behavior and sentiment?RR: This happens through a mix of resources. Mastercard has done such things as purchase key data analytics companies that have proprietary tech methods. We also work with third parties that have particular data sources, but we have also developed what we call our ‰ÛÏPriceless Engine.‰Ûù This technology enables us to track social media signals in real-time in order to determine micro-trends to see if there is an opportunity there for us to organically intersect. If there is, we create a campaign. In only 12 hours we can see whether or not our approach is working and edit accordingly. This is powerful. Micro-trends typically only last 3 days, so you have to be able to move quickly. That‰Ûªs a true focus for us.","But to get the audience of a CMO right before he takes the stage, is an even bigger ticket.Overseeing the 1.7 billion customer base that is Mastercard, Rajamannar shares insights and thoughts, separate from his public talk, on a disruptive new world full of data, politics/social issues, and marketing.Given the amount of data to which you have access, how are you handling it at Mastercard?Raja Rajamannar: First, it‰Ûªs helpful to keep in mind that Mastercard is and always has been a technology company.Mastercard has done such things as purchase key data analytics companies that have proprietary tech methods.","['advertising', 'week', 'scenes', 'powerpacked', 'rajamannar', 'world', 'technology', 'cmo', 'thats', 'ny', 'company', 'things', 'data', 'mastercard', 'today', 'trying']",,,['Lauren Delisa Coleman'],9/28/17 0:00,https://www.forbes.com/sites/laurencoleman/2017/09/28/behind-the-scenes-with-mastercard-cmo-during-power-packed-ny-advertising-week/,,,,

Pele Helps Unite Soccer Rivals in MasterCard's UEFA Champions League Campaign via McCann,"Editor's PickIn an increasingly divided world, brands are trying to bring people together and overcome prejudice. Recently, we've seen campaigns from Heineken, Ancestry and ING that aim to reunite people who are full of hostility to each other, whether for generational, political, nationality-based or in ING's case, financial reasons.MasterCard is the latest in its new global campaign for its sponsorship of the UEFA Champions League soccer tournament, via McCann. The brand invited soccer fans from 22 different countries to play in a game together. Divided into two teams, the players had to put aside their nationality-based rivalries in order to work together for a common goal: a chance to win 11 Champions League tickets.The film captures the fans' prejudices against rival nations beforehand the game, and their changed attitudes afterwards: and the final scenes see them greeted in the locker room by Brazilian soccer legend Pele. The latter is something of a stroke of genius, as Pele is one of those players who transcends nationalistic pride and is admired by everyone. He also looks geniunely moved by the event -- which elevates this beyond the simplistic ""let's sort out the world's problems"" theme.The campaign is by McCann New York/McCann Worldgroup Europe, with the film produced via Fish Films. It breaks as the UEFA Champions League is now at the Knockout stage, with the final set to be played in Kiev on May 26.","MasterCard is the latest in its new global campaign for its sponsorship of the UEFA Champions League soccer tournament, via McCann.The brand invited soccer fans from 22 different countries to play in a game together.Divided into two teams, the players had to put aside their nationality-based rivalries in order to work together for a common goal: a chance to win 11 Champions League tickets.The campaign is by McCann New York/McCann Worldgroup Europe, with the film produced via Fish Films.It breaks as the UEFA Champions League is now at the Knockout stage, with the final set to be played in Kiev on May 26.","['soccer', 'players', 'unite', 'uefa', 'helps', 'league', 'game', 'champions', 'pele', 'mastercards', 'nationalitybased', 'final', 'mccann', 'rivals']",,,['Alexandra Jardine'],,http://creativity-online.com/work/mastercard-22-languages/53948,,,,

Mastercard Memorial Cup berths within reach as Championship play gets underway ‰ÛÒ CHL,"The Ed Chynoweth Cup, J. Ross Robertson Cup and President Cup are all on the line this week as Championship play gets underway from coast-to-coast.While hoisting these prestigious trophies is the immediate goal, a championship crown also opens a gateway to Regina for the 100th Mastercard Memorial Cup Showcase where four teams will battle for national supremacy and the coveted Memorial Cup trophy.The matchups are set as the Everett Silvertips, Swift Current Broncos, Sault Ste. Marie Greyhounds, Hamilton Bulldogs, Blainville-Boisbriand Armada and Acadie-Bathurst Titan are left standing, fighting for a chance to join the host Regina Pats in the Queen City starting on May 17th.Here‰Ûªs an overview of the three league championship matchups that get underway beginning in Sault Ste. Marie on Thursday night.ROGERS OHL CHAMPIONSHIP SERIES:(1) Sault Ste. Marie Greyhounds vs. (1) Hamilton Bulldogsfor the J. Ross Robertson CupThe cream has risen to the top in the Ontario Hockey League as both first-place clubs from the Western and Eastern Conferences have emerged as league finalists.The Sault Ste. Marie Greyhounds begin on home ice, reaching the Rogers OHL Championship Series following consecutive Game 7 victories over the Owen Sound Attack and Kitchener Rangers. Anaheim Ducks prospect Jack Kopacka scored the double-overtime winner in Game 7 to eliminate Kitchener and bring a capacity crowed to its feet at the Essar Centre on Monday.The Hounds are the first West Division team to reach the Final since the 2010 Windsor Spitfires went on to win their second of back-to-back Mastercard Memorial Cup titles.It‰Ûªs been a long time coming for the Greyhounds, who have returned to their early 90‰Ûªs dominance that saw them win back-to-back OHL Championships in 1991 and 1992 before hoisting the Memorial Cup on home ice in 1993.Powered by Tampa Bay Lightning prospects Boris Katchouk (15-13‰ÛÒ28) and defending OHL champion Taylor Raddysh (12-15‰ÛÒ27) up front, the Hounds come off their best season in franchise history, finishing the campaign as the CHL‰Ûªs top-ranked club with a 55-7-3-3 record.A well-rested Eastern Conference champion Hamilton Bulldogs club awaits them, reaching their first league final in just their third season in Hamilton.The Bulldogs have cruised to three-straight five game series wins over Ottawa, Niagara and Kingston, getting contributions from up and down the lineup. St. Louis Blues first round pick Robert Thomas (8-17‰ÛÒ25) and mid-season acquisitions in Ryan Moore (7-14‰ÛÒ21) and Nicholas Caamano (6-12‰ÛÒ18) have been prominent producers while fourth-year centreman Brandon Saigeon (12-4‰ÛÒ16) leads the team in playoff goal-scoring.The City of Hamilton‰Ûªs OHL history includes a 1978 finals appearance by the Fincups which was preceded by a 1976 title, while the 1962 Hamilton Red Wings were also Robertson Cup champions.The two clubs split their two meetings during the season series, with Hamilton winning 5-2 on February 11th before Sault Ste. Marie struck back in a big way, defeating the Bulldogs 10-0 at home on February 16th.OHL PLAYOFF BRACKETSSERIES SCHEDULE:Game 1, Thurs., May 3 at Sault Ste.

Marie, 7:07 pm**if necessaryROGERS WHL CHAMPIONSHIP SERIES(2) Swift Current Broncos vs. (1) Everett Silvertipsfor the Ed Chynoweth CupThe Swift Current Broncos have emerged from a highly competitive Eastern Conference to face an Everett Silvertips club that boasts the CHL‰Ûªs stingiest defence after surrendering just 167 goals over 72 games.An intriguing matchup between two clubs that met just once during the regular season, the Broncos open the series on home ice with Games 1 and 2 on Friday and Saturday at the Credit Union I-Plex.Swift Current has had quite a ride through the WHL Playoffs, requiring back-to-back Game 7 finishes to oust provincial rivals in the Regina Pats and Moose Jaw Warriors in the opening two rounds. A six game series triumph over the Lethbridge Hurricanes crowned them Eastern Conference champs for the first time since 1993.The dangerous trio of Glenn Gawdin (9-16‰ÛÒ25), Tyler Steenbergen (11-13‰ÛÒ24) and Aleksi Heponiemi (3-21‰ÛÒ24) has been among the CHL‰Ûªs top units all season and is complemented by other high-scoring veterans in Giorgio Estephan (11-8‰ÛÒ19) and Matteo Gennaro (8-4‰ÛÒ12).In goal, long-time WHL veteran Stuart Skinner has been one of Swift Current‰Ûªs biggest difference-makers throughout the playoffs, posting a 2.32 goals-against average, .927 save percentage, 12-6-2 record and four shutouts. The Edmonton Oilers prospect squares off against back-to-back WHL Goaltender of the Year Carter Hart who has backstopped the Silvertips to their first Western Conference title since 2004.While he has received high praise throughout the season, it‰Ûªs hard to overlook the contributions of the Canadian World Junior gold medalist between the pipes in Everett. The Philadelphia Flyers prospect posted a minuscule 1.60 goals-against average and .947 save percentage in 41 games this season, tying the CHL‰Ûªs all-time shutouts record with 26 in his regular season career.Everett took a path through the U.S. Division to reach the WHL Final, eliminating the Seattle Thunderbirds and Portland Winterhawks in five games before fifth-year blueliner Kevin Davis (3-11‰ÛÒ14) stepped up with the Game 6 overtime winner to oust the Tri-City Americans on Monday.While goaltending is key come playoff-time, the ‰Û÷Tips didn‰Ûªt get this far on defence alone. Washington Capitals prospect Garrett Pilon (11-13‰ÛÒ24) has led the way offensively while ageless overage veteran Patrick Bajkov, the club‰Ûªs all-time leading scorer, trails close behind with 21 points (13-8‰ÛÒ21). Connor Dewar (9-12‰ÛÒ21) and Riley Sutter (6-8‰ÛÒ14) join overager Matt Fonteyne (6-14‰ÛÒ20) in providing secondary scoring up front.Everett defeated Swift Current 4-1 in their lone meeting back on January 21st.WHL PLAYOFF BRACKETSSERIES SCHEDULE:Game 1, Fri., May 4 at Swift Current, 7:00 pmGame 2, Sat., May 5 at Swift Current, 7:00 pmGame 3, Tues., May 8 at Everett, 7:05 pmGame 4, Wed., May 9 at Everett, 7:05 pmGame 5, Fri., May 11 at Everett, 7:35 pm*Game 6, Sun., May 13 at Swift Current, 7:00 pm*Game 7, Mon., May 14 at Swift Current, 7:00 pm**if necessaryAll times localROGERS PRESIDENT CUP FINAL(1) Blainville-Boisbriand Armada vs. (2) Acadie-Bathurst Titanfor the President CupThe QMJHL‰Ûªs top-two teams clash for the President Cup beginning Friday night in Blainville as the host Armada take on the Acadie-Bathurst Titan.The QMJHL‰Ûªs only 100-point team, Blainville-Boisbriand sat wire-to-wire atop the standings before eliminating the Val-d‰ÛªOr Foreurs and Moncton Wildcats in short order. The Armada required seven games to dispatch the Charlottetown Islanders, taking a 6-1 win at home on Tuesday as star veteran Alexandre Alain had three goals and two assists.Blainville‰Ûªs big three featuring Alain (16-12‰ÛÒ28), Drake Batherson (10-17‰ÛÒ27) and Alex Barre-Boulet (11-12‰ÛÒ23) lead the QMJHL Playoffs in scoring while goaltender Emile Samson has gone undefeated in regulation, posting a 2.01 goals-against average and .921 save percentage in 15 games.The Armada return to the President Cup Final after falling to Saint John last year, but face a new challenge in Acadie-Bathurst, a team they defeated by one-goal margins in each of their two encounters this season.The Titan boast one of the CHL‰Ûªs top bluelines powered by overage standout Olivier Galipeau (4-11‰ÛÒ15) and smooth-skating draft prospect Noah Dobson (1-8‰ÛÒ9). General Manager Sylvain Couturier has been busy this season, adding talented forwards in German Rubtsov (4-5‰ÛÒ9) and the currently injured Mitchell Balmas (5-4‰ÛÒ9) to join franchise cornerstones Jeffrey Truchon-Viel (11-7‰ÛÒ18) and Antoine Morand (5-10‰ÛÒ15) on the attack.In goal, St. Louis Blues prospect Evan Fitzpatrick leads the QMJHL Playoffs with a 1.99 goals-against average to go with a .927 save percentage and 12-2 record over 14 games.The Titan won their first Maritimes Division title since 2002 this past season and have their sights set on the franchise‰Ûªs first President Cup since its inaugural season back in 1999.QMJHL PLAYOFF BRACKETSSERIES SCHEDULE:Game 1, Fri., May 4 at Blainville-Boisbriand, 7:00 pm (Sportsnet/TVA Sports)Game 2, Sat., May 5 at Blainville-Boisbriand, 7:00 pm (TVA Sports)Game 3, Tues., May 8 at Acadie-Bathurst, 6:30 pm (TVA Sports)Game 4, Wed., May 9 at Acadie-Bathurst,6:30 pm (TVA Sports)Game 5, Fri., May 11 at Blainville-Boisbriand, 7:00 pm* (TVA Sports)Game 6, Sun., May 13 at Acadie-Bathurst, 3:00 pm* (TVA Sports)Game 7, Tues., May 15 at Blainville-Boisbriand, 7:00 pm* (TVA Sports)*if necessaryAll times local","The Ed Chynoweth Cup, J.

How CEO Ajay Banga Is Transforming Mastercard Into A Digital Disruptor,"Mastercard has had a positive year in terms of performance. Does that mean you are seeing a robust uptick in consumer spending across the geographies you operate in?We are seeing generally positive trends in consumer spending across the globe. Of course, there are bright spots and weaker ones, but overall consumer spending and confidence are trending positive. We are also growing our share of payments through our core business of credit, debit, prepaid and commercial payments. And we are growing the services that provide additional value beyond the core payment ‰ÛÒ safety and security, loyalty and rewards, and insights and data analytics that support our customers‰Ûª businesses. All these are helping our performance this year.In 2018 and in the medium term, which would be the growth areas for Mastercard?Today, more than 80% of the world‰Ûªs consumer payments are still made with cash. With the exception of a few markets like South Korea and the Nordics, cash continues to dominate retail transactions. That‰Ûªs our opportunity across the globe, converting them into electronic payments, with a card, a digital wallet or any other way that you might access a Mastercard account.We‰Ûªre taking our learnings from many markets and combining them with local insights and experiences. This will help deliver new innovations that drive the conversion from cash. This opportunity exists beyond retail purchases. There‰Ûªs the commercial and B2B space, meeting the needs of global corporations and small and micro merchants. It‰Ûªs also P2P and B2C payments. We are building the tools and services to tap into this bigger opportunity. That‰Ûªs what we‰Ûªve been doing in diversifying our customer base and building new businesses.How has Masterpass performed in the region since its launch? Has it fared well across other markets for you and how are you further developing it?Masterpass has been live in the U.A.E. and across Africa for some time now. This year, we brought the Masterpass platform into Egypt and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and we are already seeing interest among both merchants and consumers Masterpass is relevant since consumers have said they prefer to continue to manage their payment accounts with the banks where they have the trusted relationship. With Masterpass, they don‰Ûªt need to update account details at multiple merchant sites or remembering separate wallet usernames and passwords. Merchants too like the proposition of an issuer-based wallet, as it can simplify the experience for them.Many times, card users are charged a fee when swiping a card in markets that are yet to mature. What is your strategy in markets such as those?A fee paid by consumers is unfortunate because it creates friction around electronic payments in favor of the alternative‰ÛÓcash. Using cash is expensive for consumers and for businesses. There are costs associated with printing, securing, distributing and handling cash. It can cost a nation as much as 1% of GDP. On the other hand, there‰Ûªs a great value in electronic payments. Merchants benefit by having lower costs associated with handling cash, while at the same time seeing a lift in the average ticket size. We‰Ûªre working to educate merchants, consumers and governments on why a checkout fee like this is a bad idea.As transactions shift online, security is a valid concern among users. Is it a challenge for Mastercard to be airtight when it comes to payment security? How much do you invest in securing your platforms annually?Security can‰Ûªt be an afterthought, but it also cannot be about creating an impenetrable wall. Trust is built by considering both security and convenience as equally important aspects of innovation. Technology can help deliver that trust.At Mastercard, we are integrating security into all that we do. Security sits front-and-center in all of our payment solutions, connections and initiatives. We stay one step ahead by building multiple layers of security to protect every transaction.We‰Ûªre playing a leadership role in developing standards, like EMV, QR, contactless and tokens, to make the payment experience fast, safe and easy. We are pioneering the use of biometrics, including building it into a card, because it‰Ûªs more secure and convenient than a password. We‰Ûªre embedding behavioral analytics, machine learning and artificial intelligence across our network to continually screen for risks and stop catastrophic fraud in its tracks. One of our more recent acquisitions‰ÛÓNuData Security‰ÛÓhas some very cool technology that enables us to actually know that it‰Ûªs really you who are using the device, based on how you hold the phone or type on the screen. This is all helpful in authenticating the user or account holder. Our Brighterion business is leveraging artificial intelligence to deliver better insights for our customers and a better consumer experience.Considering this is the age of disruption, has Mastercard ever been disrupted by smaller fintech companies? If no, how do you manage to not be disrupted?Mastercard has a long history of supporting and enabling emerging industry players. We believe that our collaboration with both established digital players and startups allow us to stay ahead of the innovation curve, thanks to their unconventional approach to technological advancement. In fact, we have a dedicated Start Path Global program, which enables us to work very closely with innovative global start-ups across not only fintech, but also retail, security and Big Data sectors; with companies that are deeply passionate about building the technologies of the future. The companies who will thrive in today‰Ûªs digital age will be shaped by three dominant forces, namely a growing global middle class that is financially able to transact, improved experiences brought about through connected devices, analytics and personalization and increased complexity in delivering services like security that require new partners and perspectives. Each of these forces will require a new appreciation and prioritization‰ÛÓon partnership. And that‰Ûªs something deeply embedded in our DNA.The Middle East market has traditionally been lenient to cash rather than cards but there has been commendable effort from the governments to ensure a transition to a cashless society. In that light, is the Middle East a promising market for you?I think of the Middle East and Africa as a market of extreme interest and intelligence in the government, in terms of technocrats coming into power and applying business logic to get scalable solutions to uplift people‰Ûªs lives. I do see that. I also see that these economies have large populations‰ÛÓI mean Africa alone is a billion people‰ÛÓand how can you hold that back from where it needs to go? There is a right kind of government thinking, and there is the energy of a very young population that is looking for ways to connect in a technically enabled way. This region also has people who have more phones than bank accounts, and everybody uses technology like a tech native. This indicates a growing opportunity here. Just in MENA, we have double the number of locations that we operate in since I became CEO. We‰Ûªve tripled the number of employees, we‰Ûªve doubled the number of acceptance locations where electronic payments can go, and in fact, I‰Ûªve been discussing with the regional head an opportunity to double that again in the next few years.You have, at various instances, extolled the importance of a cashless society. How does it help in financial inclusion and what are some of the steps that Mastercard have taken to decrease the unbanked population?Financial inclusion is a very misunderstood term. People think you open a bank account, and you‰Ûªre included. It isn‰Ûªt really like that, unless you do something with that bank account, meaning money‰Ûªs going to come in, money‰Ûªs going to go out, you‰Ûªre going to save something, you‰Ûªre going to get access to credit at a reasonable price, and you‰Ûªre going to be able to get insurance. The real inclusion comes from the pathway to regular income and prosperity and credit and insurance, and dignity, which comes with all this. So that‰Ûªs what inclusion is. Now, my belief is that the way you‰Ûªve got to go about this is you‰Ûªve got to get people to have access to some way of receiving and spending and saving money. So what we‰Ûªre doing around the world is we work with governments, with NGOs, and others, to try and find a way to get these people out of the system, get them an identity, and then get them access to some form of receiving money.For example, in South Africa, the social security agency delivers benefits to 13 to 14 million South Africans. It previously used to be distributed via an agent network where a truck would come with cash, and you‰Ûªd have to go there and prove who you are. Then you would take the cash and walk home through a shanty town with everyone knowing that you‰Ûªre carrying the cash back to your place. This has all been changed to a biometric enabled identity system on one side of a card, so you can prove your identity with a fingerprint. The other side of the card has a payment functionality, allowing you to go to an ATM to spend or save on the card. This helps the consumer, and it helps the government find people who were wrongly claiming the money. In South Africa between 10-13% of people were fraudulent claims‰ÛÓpeople who had died, people who did not exist, etc. all had others claiming their money. All of these people were taken out, and that efficiency allows the government to reach more people, or frankly to save the money, depending on what your priorities are.Users today are shifting from physical plastic money to virtual money such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. How are you dealing with such seismic changes and will such factors disrupt you going forward?I‰Ûªm not sure that cryptocurrency is growing. The price is growing but the price will grow today and drop tomorrow. That‰Ûªs currency, and bubbles, and investments. If you want to invest in them and if you think you‰Ûªre a sophisticated investor, you should. But to think that you can use those for a payment methodology, where you‰Ûªre buying a bottle of water for one Bitcoin today and tomorrow its worth eight bottles of water and the day after that its two, and the day after that its 10, you‰Ûªll be confused as a retailer and consumer. We talk about hyperinflation and hyper deflation‰ÛÓthis is hyperinflation on steroids if it goes back and forth like that. You need stability and transparency.Blockchain, on the other hand, or government mandated cryptocurrencies, are different. If there‰Ûªs a sovereign entity backing a cryptocurrency, it‰Ûªs the same as a sovereign entity backing a regular currency. I see value there. The blockchain is interesting and though the case for it is not proven yet but the idea has. So, what we‰Ûªre doing as a company is we‰Ûªre investing in blockchains to learn how they work, find patterns, and then work with patterns. I think the blockchain needs to be thought through and constructed in a way that will enable the unlocking of its power in a way that works for society in a sensible pattern. I‰Ûªm quite interested in blockchain and I think there‰Ûªs something there, so we‰Ûªve been investing large sums of money and effort into it.","We are also growing our share of payments through our core business of credit, debit, prepaid and commercial payments.Today, more than 80% of the world‰Ûªs consumer payments are still made with cash.That‰Ûªs our opportunity across the globe, converting them into electronic payments, with a card, a digital wallet or any other way that you might access a Mastercard account.Is it a challenge for Mastercard to be airtight when it comes to payment security?If you want to invest in them and if you think you‰Ûªre a sophisticated investor, you should.","['cash', 'payment', 'ajay', 'card', 'think', 'ceo', 'disruptor', 'digital', 'banga', 'payments', 'transforming', 'youre', 'consumer', 'money', 'mastercard', 'way', 'security']",,,"['Mary Sophia', 'Forbes Middle East Staff']",2017-12-18 15:23:07+00:00,https://www.forbesmiddleeast.com/en/how-ceo-ajay-banga-is-transforming-mastercard-into-a-digital-disruptor/,,,,

Sachin met Binny in India after not making a high enough grade at his college and after Binny got turned down several times for a job at Google.The two left Amazon in 2007 without taking full time jobs (the Economic Times reports it was their choice to leave Amazon) to return to India.They then founded Flipkart, initially as a price comparison site. A decade later, Flipkart is the largest e-commerce company in India, and will become part of Walmart. The Bansals are reportedly both expected to become billionaires as a result of the deal.From the WebArtificial intelligence could beckon new innovation wave: MasterCard execFox Business | Wed May 9, 2018 - Artificial intelligence is an emerging field that provides new benefits and capabilities, according to Ed McLaughlin, MasterCard president of operations and technology.

Mastercard tests pay as you go for solar energy in Africa,"Solar energy is the key to getting power to many parts of Africa, but it is expensive to implement and often difficult for individuals to purchase. So global payments firm Mastercard has teamed up with solar energy company M-KOPA Solar, banks, and mobile network operators to enable payments and commerce for people who don‰Ûªt have access to banks. The alliance will enable consumers to pay for solar energy as they use it.About 625 million people in sub-Saharan African and 1.2 billion people worldwide have little or no access to electricity.‰ÛÏWe view access to energy as a basic human right,‰Ûù said Kiki Del Valle, senior vice president of commerce at Mastercard, in an interview with VentureBeat. ‰ÛÏMastercard is trying to tackle the problem by bringing more modernized, reliable energy to more people. It‰Ûªs part of our inclusion initiative, as energy access plays a critical role in enabling health, gender equality, economic opportunity, security, biological sustainability, and a lot of other key measures of human development. That is why we are interested in solar.‰ÛùImage Credit: MastercardMastercard unveiled its plans for a new kind of digital payment at the Mobile World Congress event in Barcelona. The company and its partners will enable M-KOPA to extend its pay-as-you-go program without worrying about how customers will make payments.The program is an easy way to bring basic utilities to remote and rural areas. But without easy payment solutions, it is hard to implement and scale. Mastercard is using its Masterpass QR codes, an open and interoperable technology that provides people with any type of mobile phone the ability to safely make purchases without using cash or a plastic card.‰ÛÏPicture today‰Ûªs model, with women or men walking kilometers to go to a store,‰Ûù Del Valle said. ‰ÛÏThey buy a kerosene jug. They pay cash. Then they walk home. They use it for lighting or cooking or whatever. That is their experience today.‰ÛùImage Credit: Mastercard‰ÛÏWhat we‰Ûªre actually doing, as a QR merchant ‰ÛÓ M-KOPA will be able to access payments to millions of consumers. We embed a QR code within the device itself, minimizing the cost of the hardware for that device and making it easier for consumers to make a payment,‰Ûù Del Valle said. ‰ÛÏThe consumer opens a telco app. They use a mobile money pop-up account. They will scan the code. They will enter the device ID. We find a device ID to the merchant. I type in the device ID into the application. I type in the amount of funding I can take. We created an application programming interface (API) to bind the device ID to the merchant ID. So an alert is sent to M-KOPA. Once the payment is made, they can send credits to the device. That device can then be used for the next couple of days.‰ÛùThe solar panel itself has a device ID.‰ÛÏIt is now a smart device,‰Ûù Del Valle said. ‰ÛÏThat device ID of the solar panel and merchant ID helps facilitate the payment. I only use the mobile phone to scan the QR code and pay. They can set this up easily, and it uses existing infrastructure. There is no lower limit on how much money can be spent on transactions.‰ÛùMastercard is rolling the pilot test out in Uganda later this year, and it will expand to other markets sometime this year.In Africa, Masterpass QR is currently available in Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Uganda. This network will help M-KOPA scale and grow beyond its existing markets without requiring technology investments.Many sub-Saharan Africans rely on bio and fossil fuels, such as wood, charcoal, and kerosene. Solar is an independent way for people to power homes and businesses but is unaffordable for many, as it requires a large, one-time investment. The actual cost of purchasing and installing M-KOPA solar equipment is close to $200.Image Credit: MastercardWith the pay-as- you-go program, M-KOPA customers will be able to access an interest-free installment plan with a small down payment of $35 and daily payments as low as 5 cents a day. M-KOPA customers will be able to make daily payments or top up their accounts by either scanning a Quick Response (QR) code or by entering the merchant ID associated with the QR code into their feature phone.‰ÛÏWe want to provide a convenient and inexpensive way to power Africa, and our partnership with Mastercard provides the roadway for more solar services and infrastructure across the continent,‰Ûù said Nick Hughes, cofounder and chief product officer at M-KOPA Solar, in a statement. ‰ÛùQR technology will make payments easier and ubiquitous and will make it easier for us to scale easily and quickly across multiple markets, instead of worrying about individually integrating with different payment systems.‰ÛùImage Credit: MastercardAfter doing the pilot in Uganda, Mastercard and M-KOPA plan to extend the program across East Africa. Mastercard will also be extended this model to other utility providers in developing markets across the world. Del Valle said that new kinds of services could emerge with the same kind of infrastructure as the solar example.‰ÛÏAs a consumer, I can prepay my energy consumption for my next two days, and the financial system is based on that,‰Ûù Del Valle said. ‰ÛÏIt moves always from the post-billing system, and it is not only going to be limited to energy.‰ÛÏNow we can move into other areas, enabling new forms of payments,‰Ûù Del Valle said. ‰ÛÏWe are looking for other opportunities where technology can bring incremental value to people. We can bring greater control to consumers so they can pay in whatever amount they want.‰Ûù","Solar energy is the key to getting power to many parts of Africa, but it is expensive to implement and often difficult for individuals to purchase.So global payments firm Mastercard has teamed up with solar energy company M-KOPA Solar, banks, and mobile network operators to enable payments and commerce for people who don‰Ûªt have access to banks.The alliance will enable consumers to pay for solar energy as they use it.That device can then be used for the next couple of days.‰ÛùThe solar panel itself has a device ID.The actual cost of purchasing and installing M-KOPA solar equipment is close to $200.","['energy', 'mkopa', 'valle', 'id', 'pay', 'solar', 'payments', 'africa', 'device', 'qr', 'tests', 'mastercard', 'payment']",,,['Dean Takahashi'],2/26/18 0:00,https://venturebeat.com/2018/02/26/mastercard-tests-pay-as-you-go-for-solar-energy-in-africa/,,,,

"Will the Mastercard/Visa 'button' make history, or be lost to the ages?","It's a problem as old as the internet: What is the easiest way to get consumers to pay online? So far the only thing everyone agrees on is that 16-digit account numbers aren't the answer.That said, earlier efforts like V.me and PayPass Wallet ‰ÛÓ and even internet currencies like Beenz and Flooz ‰ÛÓ are already outdated. What Mastercard and Visa are now attempting with EMVCo's Secure Remote Commerce (SRC) Framework could meet the same fate, but it could also finally crack the code.A longstanding problem with the card networks current digital wallets, Masterpass and Visa Checkout, is that their branding fails to communicate their support of other networks' cards. Visa Checkout supports Mastercard and Masterpass supports Visa, but what consumer would ever think to test that?Adobe Stock""In the traditional environment you walk into a store, take out a card and pay at the terminal; it's ubiquitous,"" said Jess Turner, executive vice president of digital payments and labs of North America at Mastercard. ""The digital world is not all of the way there yet.""Using SRC, a standard designed to encourage similar processes for card not present payments, Masterpass and Visa Checkout could potentially merge into a single online payment system, which has been referred to a single payment ""button."" The networks discussed this concept at an industry conference in Las Vegas, saying it would simplify online payments for consumers, issuers and merchants.It's too soon to tell whether an SRC button would replace Visa Checkout and Masterpass as brands. It's also unclear why consumers would choose another new payment option over the many options available today ‰ÛÓ such as PayPal.According to Mastercard, the plan may develop into an option that runs alongside Masterpass and Visa Checkout rather than trying to shoehorn all payments through a single wallet.""Mastercard believes that one common checkout experience is what works best, but having competing checkout options for consumers and merchants are a good thing,"" Turner said.Mastercard has not entered into a formal collaboration with Visa, Turner said, adding the branding and logistics of the single-user experience has to be developed over time and Mastercard will continue to develop differentiated digital payment technology and services.The point of this week's announcement is to achieve a ""token only"" payments world, in which online payments have a consistency similar to card payments, Turner said.Still, there's a chance that something new could improve the user experience of online and mobile payments, Turner said.""If you try to buy something on a mobile phone now, you key in the number, which isn't perfect,"" Turner said, adding that has led to different approaches to achieving low navigation digital payments. ""Some merchants are moving to 'card on file' storage, but not every merchant does card on file.""The SRC standards should permit choices, such as whether to support card on file, or other methods of reducing navigation for online purchase, without that resulting in consumer experiences that differ from one merchant to another, according to Turner.One thing that is clear is there is a huge untapped market for online payments, even given the ubiquity of the modern internet.Mastercard has reported more than 85 million ""enabled"" users for Masterpass, though that doesn't necessarily equate to usage. And Visa has reported an enrollment of about 33 million consumers for Visa Checkout. By comparison, PayPal has 227 million active users.Ultimately, Visa and Mastercard want standardized and tokenized online payments that work similar to the ease and ubiquity of plastic cards, but in doing so they risk confusing a market they have spent considerable effort to build.""Quite literally hundreds of millions of marketing dollars have been invested into Visa Checkout and Masterpass over the years to raise merchant and consumer awareness,"" said Jordan McKee, a principal analyst at 451 Research. ""Any decision to walk away from these investments will not be taken lightly.""Masterpass and Visa Checkout have had relatively low usage, creating an impetus for change. According to 451 Research's Voice of the Connected User Landscape Representative Survey, only 3% of U.S. consumers used Visa Checkout in the past 90 days, and only 1% have used Masterpass. ""The networks still have a long way to go to increase consumer and merchant adoption of their wallets,"" McKee said.Nearly two thirds of consumers used PayPal to make online or mobile payments at least once in the past year, compared to 22% for Visa Checkout and 8% for Masterpass, according to Dow Jones , citing Bernstein Research.""Neither Masterpass nor Visa Checkout have achieved a competitive position against PayPal or Amazon, and with the increasing importance of e- and m-commerce, it‰Ûªs important that the networks find a way to be competitive,"" said Thad Peterson, a senior analyst at Aite Group. ""Working with a uniform approach they have a much better opportunity to create a payment tool that cardholders and their issuers will find valuable. Customers like simple, and this potentially is a move in the right direction for the networks.""But could that include PayPal as a collaborator instead of a rival? Both Mastercard and Visa have data cooperation agreements with PayPal that ended years of ranker, particularly on Visa's part. The deals, which date to the summer of 2016, involve PayPal promising equal visibility to the card networks and ACH as funding options, among other incentives. Amex this week also expressed its interest in a single online payment system. PayPal did not return requests for comment by deadline.In a statement, Amex said it supports the exploration of a common user interface for SRC: ""We believe providing a consistent experience for consumers and merchants, whether they are purchasing or selling through a mobile app, desktop browser or other internet-connected device, is integral to the future growth of digital commerce.""In an emailed statement, Visa said the transition to the SRC standard will be complete by the end of 2018. Visa has started rolling out parts of the program, including streamlined verification, and any potential button branding changes or other pieces should evolve once EMVCo has finished defining brand standards, Visa said. It said it is collaborating with financial institutions, acquirers and gateway commerce platforms, merchants and new participants to execute a migration plan for existing Visa Checkout users and a pull-through plan to build new acceptance. In its email, Visa expressed hope the effort will draw more participants.Simplifying checkout and encouraging a more usable and consistent online shopping and payment experience for different merchants and payment companies would fix a problem that's plaguing online commerce.The network SRC announcements ""serve as acknowledgments that that current checkout approach in digital commerce is broken,"" McKee said. ""Shoppers are confronted with inconsistent and laborious checkout experiences that led to cart abandonment and lost sales.""Cart abandonment in e-commerce is extraordinarily high. Barilliance, an e-commerce consultant and services provider, pegs it as high as 75% and says the problem is getting worse. An easier experience could help improve those numbers.Both Checkout and Masterpass have a long history. Visa Checkout dates in some form as far back as 2010 through a feature called Rightcliq. Rightcliq had a browser plugin to automatically populate checkout information, as well as a social component. Visa discontinued Rightcliq in 2011, shortly before launching another product, called V.me. V.me was a P2P app that planned to launch other payment services, such as e-commerce. V.me gave way in 2014 to Visa Checkout, with updates aimed at ""easier usage.""Masterpass launched in 2013 with a group of banks and merchants, building on the earlier PayPass Wallet Service.The networks have attracted merchants and partners to their online payment systems, creating a ready made market for consumers. Visa Checkout last year added Walmart and other retailers, and collaborated with BlueSnap to gain access to additional online merchants. Masterpass has recently made inroads into the petroleum segment and quick service. And Visa Checkout and Masterpass have also collaborated previously on security.Better checkout would further improve Mastercard and Visa's profile against brands that have become synonymous with easy checkout. Amazon' s one-click checkout has helped boost Prime membership to nearly 100 million and Uber's ""invisible"" payment system has increased users' expectations for an easier, more common experience in the card-not-present environment.Mastercard has invested in its ""digital by default"" strategy, highlighting Masterpass' relationship with popular brands and dedicating a 3% year over year increase in expenditure dedicated to advertising and marketing digital by default. Visa has also invested heavily in digital strategies over the years.","Visa Checkout supports Mastercard and Masterpass supports Visa, but what consumer would ever think to test that?It's too soon to tell whether an SRC button would replace Visa Checkout and Masterpass as brands.The point of this week's announcement is to achieve a ""token only"" payments world, in which online payments have a consistency similar to card payments, Turner said.One thing that is clear is there is a huge untapped market for online payments, even given the ubiquity of the modern internet.Visa Checkout last year added Walmart and other retailers, and collaborated with BlueSnap to gain access to additional online merchants.","['visa', 'checkout', 'button', 'online', 'masterpass', 'digital', 'history', 'ages', 'mastercard', 'payments', 'mastercardvisa', 'consumers', 'payment', 'lost', 'merchants']",,,['John Adams'],2018-04-19 15:01:04.105000-04:00,https://www.paymentssource.com/news/will-the-mastercard-visa-online-button-make-history-or-be-lost-to-the-ages,,,,

"Mastercard, IBM Launch Truata To Meet GDPR","Mastercard, the payments company, and IBM, the technology powerhouse, announced Thursday (March 15) the creation of an independent trust to help companies meet the requirements of Europe‰Ûªs upcoming privacy and data protection policies known as the European General Data Protection Regulation.In a press release, the companies said the trust ‰ÛÓ which is called TrÅÇata ‰ÛÓ has been designed specifically to help companies become compliant with GDPR and enable them to meet the standards and at the same time continue to innovate. IBM was named a foundational partner for technology and services that will include cloud, analytics and cognitive computing capabilities. Mastercard said a key component of the collaboration will be applying anonymization technologies from IBM‰Ûªs global research teams. Felix Marx, who most recently was executive vice president of services for Mastercard in Asia Pacific, will head up the trust as Chief Executive. ‰ÛÏTrÅÇata is built on the long-standing demand for data, security and privacy. This demand will be catalyzed by the arrival of the GDPR and other developments like 5G and the Internet of Things. The TrÅÇata data trust, paired with data anonymization and analytics, is a natural next step in the evolution of the data economy,‰Ûù Marx said in the press release.Mastercard noted that because of how the trust was structured from a governance perspective, TrÅÇata will operate independently of its beneficiaries and customers, giving it the ability to maintain direct control over data hosting and analytics on behalf of its clients. Mastercard is not only a founder of the initiative but it said it will be one of the first customers to use it for data anonymization and analytics.‰ÛÏAt Mastercard, data privacy and security are part of our stock in trade.

"Amazon, Twitter, Mastercard, Top Stocks Boast This Stellar Growth Trait","Amazon (AMZN) has a history of choppy profits, but late Thursday the e-commerce and cloud-computing giant delivered yet another quarter of accelerating earnings growth and revenue gains. IBD 50 stocks SVB Financial (SIVB), Twitter (TWTR), Mastercard (MA), SolarEdge Technolgies (SEDG) and Illumina (ILMN) also boast at least two quarters of faster sales and earnings growth.XAmazon is not an IBD 50 stock but it already boasts a best-possible 99 Composite Rating. The Composite Rating combines several proprietary IBD ratings into a single score. All-time stock winners often have a Composite Rating of at least 95 near the start of their big runs. SVB Financial and SolarEdge Technologies also have 99 Composite Ratings. Twitter and Mastercard have 98 CRs while Illumina boasts a 97 CR.Accelerating earnings growth is an extremely bullish trait. Ultimately earnings drive stock gains. Faster profit gains show that a company has real momentum. The faster sales growth suggests real demand, not just cost-cutting or accounting games.AmazonAmazon reported earnings per share of $3.27, more than double analyst forecasts. Year-over-year, EPS rose 121%. That was the third straight quarter of accelerating earnings growth after 40% in Q4 2017, 0% in Q3 and -78% in Q2. Sales growth accelerated for a fifth straight quarter, sprinting 43% to $51.04 billion.Being able to ramp up growth rates despite massive size is especially impressive. And Amazon isn't done. Looking to Q2, analysts see a massive 485% EPS gain.Of course, Amazon could have had solid, consistent profit growth years ago, but CEO Jeff Bezos focused on efforts to boost sales and market share. That's paying off. After recently revealing that Prime memberships have topped 100 million worldwide, Amazon said Thursday that it will hike its Prime fee $119 a year.Amazon stock shot up to a record 1,638.10 Friday morning, but faded to 1,572.62. Intraday, Amazon cleared a 1,617.64 cup base buy point but closed below that level. It did settle above an alternate entry from a 1,568.62 flawed cup-with-handle pattern. But investors probably should wait for the stock to move back above Friday's high as a buying opportunity.Keep in mind that Amazon is in a very late-stage base, after several big moves in recent years. Late-stage breakouts are less likely to be big winners and more likely to fail outright.Amazon fell 0.4% to 1,566.13 on the stock market today.TwitterThe social network early Wednesday reported adjusted earnings of 16 cents a share, up 129% vs. a year earlier. Twitter's earnings growth has accelerated for 5 straight quarters, from -31% to -22% to 0% to 11% to 73% to 129%.Revenue rose 21% vs. a year earlier to $655 million. It was the best sales gain in two years, and the fourth straight quarter of improving year-over-year changes.Twitter shares shot up before Wednesday's open, but the stock quickly fell sharply in the regular session after CEO Jack Dorsey warned that growth would likely slow later in the year.The stock fell 9% last week to 29, well below its 50-day line as it works on a consolidation.Twitter rose 4.5% to 30.31 on Monday on a new content and advertising deal with Walt Disney (DIS).SVB FinancialSVB Financial, parent of Silicon Valley Bank, late Thursday reported 90% earnings growth as revenue leapt 34% to $575 million. The $3.63 EPS was 50 cents above estimates while revenue was $39 million over views.SVB Financial's earnings and revenue growth have accelerated for five straight quarters. Silicon Valley Bank's parent also raised full-year guidance, citing faster growth in loan and deposit balances and net interest income.Unlike Amazon or Twitter, SVB Financial did not pare or reverse its initial post-earnings gains. The stock shot up 19% to 305.61 on Friday, gapping beyond a seven-week cup base entry of 271.89, MarketSmith analysis shows.Because SVB Financial opened at 300, more than 5% past the standard entry, that's a breakaway gap. A breakaway gap opening price is an alternative entry point.SVB sank 2% to 299.61 Monday.MastercardThe credit and debit card giant has reported two straight quarter of accelerating earnings growth and three quarters of faster sales growth, with year-over-year gains 33% and 20%, respectively.Mastercard's streak may be coming to an end. The card giant reports May 2. Analysts expect EPS to jump 25% to $1.26 on revenue up 18% to $3.25 billion, which would be strong but decelerating growth.Shares of Mastercard are trading within a flat base with a 183.83 buy point. The stock closed Friday 175.94.Mastercard rose 1.3% to 178.14, back above its 50-day line.Mastercard rival Visa (V,) also an IBD 50 stock, reported better-than-expected earnings last week, with EPS and revenue growth accelerating from the prior quarter.Visa cleared a 125.54 flat-base buy point on Thursday, closing Friday at 126.01. Visa rose 0.7% to 126.91 on Monday.For Visa and Mastercard, recent trading history suggests that pullbacks to the 50-day or 200-day lines are better entries than traditional buy points from breakouts.IlluminaIllumina has enjoyed four straight quarters of improving year-over-year earnings growth, trending from -11% to a 127% gain reported last week. Revenue growth has sped up for four quarters as well, from 5% to 31%.Shares initially fell on Illumina's earnings, but rallied to close the week at 244.47, above their 50-day line. The genomic testing machine maker is in a flat base with a 256.74 buy point.Illumina fell 1.4% to 240.93 on Monday.SolarEdge TechnologiesSolarEdge Technologies has had three quarters of strong accelerating earnings growth, from -29% to 166%. Revenue growth has picked up momentum for the last four quarters, with a 70% gain in the last four periods.The Israel-based company distributes solar power-harvesting components, like power optimizers and inverters, to solar companies.The stock is well extended from a Feb. 15 breakout following the latest SolarEdge earnings report. Shares have consolidated for the past few weeks. The stock closed Friday at 53.10, finding support at its 50-day line in the past few sessions.SolarEdge dipped 0.85% to 52.65 on Monday, closing below its 50-day line for the first time since Feb. 13.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:The Big Squeeze: Why The Stock Market's Bull Run Faces Its Biggest Threat In YearsFutures Rise Amid 3 Big Mergers; Apple Hits This Dubious MilestoneLululemon Leads These 5 Retail Stocks You Should Be WatchingIBD 50: The Big Lesson For Investors In 2018Payment Giant Visa Breaks Out On Earnings As Peers Make Bullish MovesApple, Tesla, Alibaba Earnings; Facebook Holds F8: Investing Action Plan","IBD 50 stocks SVB Financial (SIVB), Twitter (TWTR), Mastercard (MA), SolarEdge Technolgies (SEDG) and Illumina (ILMN) also boast at least two quarters of faster sales and earnings growth.Accelerating earnings growth is an extremely bullish trait.The faster sales growth suggests real demand, not just cost-cutting or accounting games.Twitter's earnings growth has accelerated for 5 straight quarters, from -31% to -22% to 0% to 11% to 73% to 129%.Revenue growth has picked up momentum for the last four quarters, with a 70% gain in the last four periods.","['stock', 'earnings', 'straight', 'trait', 'amazon', 'big', 'quarters', 'reported', 'growth', 'stocks', 'boast', 'revenue', 'mastercard', 'stellar', 'sales', 'twitter']",,,"[""Investor'S Business Daily"", 'Ed Carson']",2018-04-30 13:13:09-07:00,https://www.investors.com/research/amazon-twitter-mastercard-winning-earnings-growth-trait/,,,,
MasterCard Announces That Payments Can Now be Made on Blockchain,"In Brief Your credit card might soon be getting a blockchain boost - that is if you have a MasterCard. The financial services giant is offering its clients a blockchain-capable payment option for business-to-business transactions.Best of Both WorldsCredit card companies are a long-standing pillar in the financial services sector. Credit cards were the first cashless payment option made available to the public and now, one of the leading financial services firms in the world has decided that it‰Ûªs time for credit cards to get involved in blockchain technologies. On Friday, MasterCard announced that it‰Ûªs opening up access to a blockchain-based business-to-business (B2B) payment service under a new option called the ‰ÛÏMasterCard Blockchain API.‰ÛùLaunched during the Money 20/20 Hackathon in Las Vegas this past weekend after testing and validation had been completed, this service is slated to become available to customers this week. ‰ÛÏMasterCard‰Ûªs blockchain solution provides a new way for consumers, businesses and banks to transact and is key to the company‰Ûªs strategy to provide payment solutions that meet every need of financial institutions and their end-customers,‰Ûù the company said in a press statement.This move comes as a bit of a surprise, as MasterCard previously issued a blanket rejection of Bitcoin. Still, MasterCard‰Ûªs blockchain service heralds what Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin described to be blockchain‰Ûªs potential to replace credit cards. Instead of being taken over by blockchain technologies, however, MasterCard decided to embrace the movement.For Everything ElseAs a decentralized digital transaction ledger, blockchain offers MasterCard users a more private and secure option for making transactions, one that is both easily scalable and flexible. The new blockchain API builds on MasterCard‰Ûªs existing payment network, which covers some 22,000 financial institutions, and also expands blockchain‰Ûªs capability to handle transactions. The move also solves some of the challenges that B2B schemes typically have, which include ‰ÛÏspeed, transparency, and costs in cross-border payments.‰Ûù‰ÛÏBy combining MasterCard blockchain technology with our settlement network and associated network rules, we have created a solution that is safe, secure, auditable and easy to scale,‰Ûù Ken Moore, MasterCard Labs EVP, said in the press release. ‰ÛÏWhen it comes to payments, we want to provide choice and flexibility to our partners where they are able to seamlessly use both our existing and new payment rails based on the needs and requirements of their customers.‰ÛùWith a financial giant like MasterCard betting on blockchain, previous predictions by experts seem to be coming true. Blockchain is changing the way we do things ‰ÛÓ particularly financial transactions. Recently, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation opened up a payment platform that caters to those without access to traditional financial services. The blockchain revolution, however, is definitely not limited to just the world of finance. Industries like healthcare, aviation, energy, diplomacy, and education are also exploring blockchain solutions to fit their needs. There is even the possibility of a new internet powered by blockchain.In short, in the age of information, a secure yet easily trackable method of keeping tabs on data is in high demand ‰ÛÓ especially with recent hacks and security breeches. Blockchain solutions might just be what the world needs.Disclosure: Several members of the Futurism team, including the editors of this piece, are personal investors in a number of cryptocurrency markets.

How To Stop Fraud Amid Real-Time Payments,"As the speed of payments increases around the world, the potential scope of fraud shifts to targets beyond cards. Criminals are taking advantage of the global spread of real-time digital transactions to con chief financial officers, invoice managers and the like, hoping to steal massive sums before anyone knows they‰Ûªve been ripped off.That is among the themes of a recent discussion that Karen Webster had with two fraud experts from Vocalink, the Mastercard-owned payment company that powers real-time payments schemes in markets around the world: Gary Kearns, executive vice president and David Divitt, director of product. The discussion took place as countries around the world turn their attention to upgrading their legacy payments infrastructure to better meet the demands of modern banking and commerce customers: faster payments and freedom from fraud.Therein, Kearns said, lies the rub.‰ÛÏFaster payments does not necessarily mean more fraud,‰Ûù Kearns said. ‰ÛÏIt does mean that fraudsters know that they can move faster to more quickly launder money ‰ÛÓ a few minutes or hours now, instead of a day or two.‰ÛùKearns said that banks are doing a great job keeping up with the ‰ÛÏfaster fraud‰Ûù opportunities that cybercrooks are leveraging for their own nefarious gains. But the challenge, he said, is that it‰Ûªs hard for banks to see outside of their own four walls to know which otherwise normal-looking, account-to-account transfers are actually bad guys moving bad money across the network.Fast.‰ÛÏFraudsters try to take the money and move it away from victims‰Ûª banks as soon as possible,‰Ûù Divitt said, ‰ÛÏwith payments then being sent between accounts that fraudsters own or control.‰ÛùTo a bank that is not the victim of fraud, and is instead one of the many accounts that the money is passing through, such fraudulent transactions can appear as mundane as any instance of funds moving between different accounts. An effective defense essentially requires a bigger (digital) eye that can look beyond real-time threats, Kearns and Divitt said.That means a ‰ÛÏnetwork-level view‰Ûù of transactional activity, along with machine learning and artificial intelligence ‰ÛÓ or, as Kearns put it, something along the lines of ‰ÛÏhundreds of attributes being checked in 20 milliseconds.‰Ûù Such a view enables an organization to spot idiosyncrasies that other types of fraud prevention technologies might miss.‰ÛÏIt‰Ûªs more than just a rules engine,‰Ûù Divitt said about adopting the network-level, anti-fraud defenses designed to stop fraud related to real-time payments. ‰ÛÏIt‰Ûªs more than just a single type of analysis.‰ÛùAmong the signs of fraud that Big Data and pattern-finding algorithms can help spot are what Divitt and Kearns called ‰ÛÏmule accounts‰Ûù ‰ÛÓ that is, accounts opened in order for criminals to launder money, and to do so quickly.‰ÛÏThey want to move money quickly across the network and hide it, to make it look like a normal transaction,‰Ûù Kearns said. ‰ÛÏThey also have burner accounts.‰ÛùOne of the typical tasks for Vocalink Analytics is to identify those suspicious accounts and give their information to financial institutions (FIs), which must then investigate further to determine whether they are part of criminal operations. Kearns said, ‰ÛÏWe would never make the final determination ‰ÛÒ that is for the FI to discuss directly with their customers.‰ÛùThe wider those digital eyes can see, the more silos it can peer into, the better warning FIs can gain about potential and real attempts at real-time payment fraud.‰ÛÏBy doing the tracing at a network level, you can pick up on [fraud signals] weeks or months earlier than a traditional system can,‰Ûù Divitt said. ‰ÛÏYou are not necessarily looking at behavior, but at the connections and relationships in a Big Data set.‰ÛùThe stakes for fraud that relies on fast payments are substantial, typically higher than seen in thefts that involve consumer cards. A consumer who is a victim of such fraud will likely take a significant financial hit. For many businesses, though ‰ÛÒ especially small operations or the mom-and-pops (SMBs) ‰ÛÒ the aftermath of thefts that reach into the six figures or higher can be much more severe.‰ÛÏIt can lead to [the victim] going out of business, or layoffs,‰Ûù Kearns said. ‰ÛÏThere is a real social effect on this type of fraud on smaller companies.‰ÛùVocalink is already reporting that its fraud-prevention technology ‰ÛÓ Corporate Fraud Insights (CFI) ‰ÛÓ has led to approximately $9.5 million in savings for U.K-based NatWest, which uses the technology to thwart B2B invoice fraud.In most circumstances, the fraudster‰Ûªs methods are so advanced that the customer believes the transaction, usually a large payment to a familiar vendor, is completely legitimate and ends up approving the transaction. It is only now, with the CFI solution in place, that a bank can alert its customer that the transaction is potentially fraudulent, and the payment can be stopped before it‰Ûªs in the hands of the fraudster. In some instances, the fraudsters have been so professional that the banks have to convince the customer that it isn‰Ûªt a legitimate payment, noted Divitt.Realizing those savings ‰ÛÓ in fact, simply preparing an FI for the full risk that comes with real-time payments, not just the full reward ‰ÛÓ requires an increased level of awareness.‰ÛÏEducation is absolutely key,‰Ûù Divitt said. Proper education on how fraud is migrating to the faster payments environment, and how such crimes are carried out, results in ‰ÛÏpeople double-thinking when those situations arise,‰Ûù he said. ‰ÛÏIt goes a long way toward stopping those fraudsters.‰ÛùAs real-time payment systems spread to countries around the world, Divitt and Kearns view this anti-fraud technology as not only a differentiator for banks, but an insurance policy. ‰ÛÏEven if it‰Ûªs not an issue today, tomorrow it might be,‰Ûù said Kearns.","As the speed of payments increases around the world, the potential scope of fraud shifts to targets beyond cards.‰ÛÏFaster payments does not necessarily mean more fraud,‰Ûù Kearns said.An effective defense essentially requires a bigger (digital) eye that can look beyond real-time threats, Kearns and Divitt said.‰ÛÏIt‰Ûªs more than just a rules engine,‰Ûù Divitt said about adopting the network-level, anti-fraud defenses designed to stop fraud related to real-time payments.Realizing those savings ‰ÛÓ in fact, simply preparing an FI for the full risk that comes with real-time payments, not just the full reward ‰ÛÓ requires an increased level of awareness.","['accounts', 'banks', 'stop', 'divitt', 'amid', 'kearns', 'world', 'payments', 'fraud', 'money', 'payment', 'realtime']",,,[],2018-05-23 04:02:50+00:00,https://www.pymnts.com/fraud-prevention/2018/vocalink-mastercard-faster-payments-b2b-big-data/,,,,

"IFC, Mastercard extend financial inclusion for Africans","NERC hangs MYTO‰Ûªs major review reportThe Federal Government has yielded to pressure from the organised private sector (OPS)‰Ûªs as it halted the implementation of power tariff hike for one year, New Telegraph has learnt. The Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC), this newspaper understands, has, through Multi-Year Tariff Order (MYTO) review, already concluded works on the tariff hike.This tariff increase would, however, not be implemented until after the next one year when the general elections must have been concluded, a source at the Ministry of Power, Work and Housing told this newspaper.Rising under the aegis of the Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN) and Network of Electricity Consumers Advocacy of Nigeria (NECAN), the OPS had earlier registered their displeasure when the Federal Government commenced the major review of MYTO process.A correspondence exchanged between NERC and DISCOs sighted by this newspaper, showed that the Commission had, however, dump the biannual template used in tariff review for a monthly review as earlier demanded by those who, through $2.525 billion investments, bought over the defunct PHCN on Friday, November 1, 2013. ‰ÛÏThere will not be announcement and implementation of hike in power tariff until after the next 12 months,‰Ûù the source said.‰ÛÏThough works have been concluded by NERC on the review, the commission will have to hang the report because its implementation at the time is considered to be a big issue, which could swing directions of votes during the next polls.‰Ûù This newspaper had earlier reported plans by Presidency to slam an embargo covertly on the implementation. ‰ÛÏNow, that has come home to roost.There will not be tariff hike until the next one year when elections must have been concluded,‰Ûù he added. ‰ÛÏNERC has, through the Minister of Power, Works and Housing, Mr. Babatunde Fashola, briefed the president on the completion of the MYTO review.However, implementation of the order is not likely until after the general elections,‰Ûù another industry source said. ‰ÛÏThe Presidency considers this tariff issue to be one of the major elements that could shift peoples‰Ûª decisions before and during the polls, hence, the embargo of the implementation is on the card as we speak.‰ÛùThe NERC was, however, silent on the issues. Its website contains nothing relating to updates on tariff review while two MYTO contacts ‰ÛÒ Sharfuddeen Mahmoud and Aisha Mahmud, whose e-mail addresses were given on the website did not respond to mail sent to them as at the time of this report.The Federal Government had, through the agency, on June 7, given a one-month notice for major stakeholders to feed it with their positions on the plan to change the period of tariff review from every five years to monthly or quarterly ‰ÛÏin order to reflect current economic realities.‰ÛùPresident of MAN, Dr. Frank Jacobs, said on the side-lines of a stakeholders‰Ûª meeting in Lagos, that any move to review the tariff would worsen the woes of Nigeria‰Ûªs economy, which is already suffering from 95 per cent tariff increase in 13 months.Speaking through Chairman, Economic policy, MAN, Reginald Odiah, Jacobs told this newspaper that his group, which forms the larger chunk of the Maximum Demand Customers, was contacted by NERC and they completely objected to any review of MYTO.He said: ‰ÛÏWhat we know, which we want them to know, is that our budget is done yearly and any attempt to change the tariff of electricity to monthly or quarterly period, will affect our budget and worsen the harsh economic situation being faced by our members and the generality of Nigerians.‰ÛùMAN, which has membership strength of 3,500, he explained, is yet to recover from the last tariff hike and the planned review would chase out more manufacturers and drastically reduce their number in the country.Stating that cost of power for manufacturing is exorbitant in Nigeria, the MAN boss said that China spends less than 10 per cent of its production cost on electricity, while its members spend 40 per cent of their production on electricity.The DISCOs, however, disagreed with MAN and NECAN, insisting that the country deserves ‰ÛÏcost reflective tariff,‰Ûù which is not yet in place, to get the power sector working.He said: ‰ÛÏWhat we know, which we want them to know, is that our budget is done yearly and any attempt to change the tariff of electricity to monthly or quarterly period, will affect our budget and worsen the harsh economic situation being faced by our members and the generality of Nigerians.‰ÛùMAN, which has membership strength of 3,500, he explained, is yet to recover from the last tariff hike and the planned review would chase out more manufacturers and drastically reduce their number in the country.Stating that cost of power for manufacturing is exorbitant in Nigeria, the MAN boss said that China spends less than 10 per cent of its production cost on electricity, while its members spend 40 per cent of their production on electricity.

Mastercard Incorporated (MA) expected to achieve earnings growth of 18.70% for this year ‰ÛÒ Investor News Place,"Mastercard Incorporated (MA)‰Ûªs EPS growth Analysis:To gauge your chances of picking a winning stock, take a close look at its fundamentals, especially its earnings-per-share growth. Earnings per share are calculated by dividing a company‰Ûªs net income by its number of shares outstanding. Stocks with high EPS growth rates compared with year-ago levels suggest a company has products or services in strong demand.It‰Ûªs even better if the EPS growth rate has been accelerating in recent quarters and years. Strong earnings growth is essential to a stock‰Ûªs success and has the greatest impact on its future price performance. Stock with the highest EPSGR rises fastest in that year as compared to its competitors in the same industry. High growth rates in EPS are more reliable in the case of ‰Û÷matured companies‰Ûª which has experienced a complete economic cycle of expansion and contraction, through a bear market phase and a bull run.Mastercard Incorporated (MA) estimated to achieve earnings per share (EPS) growth of 18.70% for this year while EPS growth expected to touch 16.43% for next year.

The Average True Range (ATR) is also a measure of volatility is currently sitting at 3.11.Analysis of Simple Moving Average:Chart patterns can be difficult to read given the volatility in price movements. Moving averages can help smooth out these erratic movements by removing day-to-day fluctuations and make trends easier to spot. Since they take the average of past price movements, moving averages are better for accurately reading past price movements rather than predicting future past movements.The most common type of moving average is the simple moving average, which simply takes the sum of all of the past closing prices over a time period and divides the result by the total number of prices used in the calculation.Moving averages are a powerful tool for traders analyzing securities. They provide a quick glimpse at the prevailing trend and trend strength, as well as specific trading signals for reversals or breakouts. The most common timeframes used when creating moving averages are the 200, 50 and 20-day moving averages. The 200-day moving average is a good measure for a year timeframe, while shorter moving averages are used for shorter timeframes. These moving averages help traders smooth out some of the noise found in day-to-day price movements and give them a clearer picture of the trend.Mastercard Incorporated (MA) stock price performed at a change of 3.04% from 20 day SMA and stands at a distance of 5.87% away from 50 day SMA. At present time the stock is moving 20.46% away to its 200-day moving average.Short Ratio of stock is 1.73.

The average volume was noted at 3967.25K shares while its relative volume was seen at 1.03. Volume is an important technical analysis tool to learn and understand how to apply to price movements. Volume increases every time a buyer and seller transact their stock or futures contract. If a buyer buys one share of stock from a seller, then that one share is added to the total volume of that particular stock. Volume has two major premises:When prices rise or fall, an increase in volume acts as confirmation that the rise or fall in price is real and that the price movement had strength. When prices rise or fall and there is a decrease in volume, then this might be interpreted as being a weak price move, because the price move had very little strength and interest from traders.Mastercard Incorporated (MA) reported down change of -0.42% in last trading session. It is a positive indicator for investor portfolio value ‰ÛÓ when the price of a stock Investor owns goes up in value. On the other side it is not a negative indicator for Investor portfolio value ‰ÛÓ when the price of a stock Investor owns moves down in value.In the liquidity ratio analysis; current ratio was 1.6 while Total Debt/Equity ratio was 1.13.

Wilder believed that when prices rose very rapidly and therefore momentum was high enough, that the underlying financial instrument/commodity would have to eventually be considered overbought and a selling opportunity was possibly at hand. Likewise, when prices dropped rapidly and therefore momentum was low enough, the financial instrument would at some point be considered oversold presenting a possible buying opportunity.There are set number ranges within RSI that Wilder consider useful and noteworthy in this regard. According to Wilder, any number above 70 should be considered overbought and any number below 30 should be considered oversold. An RSI between 30 and 70 was to be considered neutral and an RSI around 50 signified no trend. ‰ÛÒ Some traders believe that Wilder‰Ûªs overbought/oversold ranges are too wide and choose to alter those ranges. For example, someone might consider any number above 80 as overbought and anything below 20 as undersold. This is entirely at the trader‰Ûªs discretion.

MasterCard files a patent application for a quick blockchain node verification system,"MasterCard filed a new patent application on April 26, regarding the blockchain verification process. The patent application is filed for a system which is basically for speeding up blockchain node verification process.MasterCard outlined their method in the abstract of the patent application. It is written,‰ÛÏA method for generating a blockchain configured for fast navigation includes: storing a blockchain comprised of a plurality of blocks, each block including a header comprised of a fast track flag, fast track reference, timestamp, and hash value, where the plurality of blocks includes standard blocks having a deactivated fast track flag and fast track blocks having an activated fast track flag; identifying a most recent fast track block based on the timestamp in the fast track blocks; identifying a most recent overall block based on the timestamp included in the plurality of blocks; generating a fast track hash value via hashing the most recent fast track block; generating a chain hash value via hashing the most recent overall block; and writing a new block to the blockchain including a block header comprised of a timestamp, activated fast track flag, the fast track hash value, and the chain hash value.‰ÛùThe application states benefits of having Blockchain. It says,‰ÛÏOne of the benefits of the blockchain is it can serve as an immutable ledger that stores a record for every transaction ever conducted via that blockchain. As such, a blockchain may store thousands, millions, or even billions of transaction records over time in a vast number of different blocks. However, this may cause a difficulty for any new node that wants to participate in the blockchain. In such instances, a blockchain may contain thousands, millions, or billions of blocks, each of which must be verified by the new node prior to the generation and addition of new blocks to the blockchain.‰ÛùThe application also states the reason as to why a technical solution is required to speed the verification process.It states,‰ÛÏThe verification of such a large number of blocks may take a significant amount of time, during which new blocks may be added to the blockchain, further delaying the ability for the new node to participate.Thus, there is a need for a technical solution to increase the speed at which a blockchain may be navigated for verification thereof, which can thereby reduce the time required for a new node to begin participating in the blockchain.‰ÛùThe solution is also highlighted to overcome the speed issue in the blockchain node verification process. It stated, ‰ÛÏThe use of specialized flags and hash values included in the headers of blocks in a blockchain may enable for the speed of navigation of a blockchain to be significantly increased, which may greatly reduce the computing time and power required to verify the blockchain. As a result, navigation and verification of the blockchain may be more efficient, which may increase the ability for new nodes to participate in the blockchain, and for users and nodes to review the blockchain to identify specific transaction records.‰ÛùFew days back, the report stated that MasterCard hired 175 employees to invigorate innovation and for efforts to create a world beyond fiat currency.Image via Shutterstock","MasterCard filed a new patent application on April 26, regarding the blockchain verification process.The patent application is filed for a system which is basically for speeding up blockchain node verification process.MasterCard outlined their method in the abstract of the patent application.However, this may cause a difficulty for any new node that wants to participate in the blockchain.Thus, there is a need for a technical solution to increase the speed at which a blockchain may be navigated for verification thereof, which can thereby reduce the time required for a new node to begin participating in the blockchain.‰ÛùThe solution is also highlighted to overcome the speed issue in the blockchain node verification process.","['files', 'node', 'application', 'blockchain', 'patent', 'fast', 'system', 'quick', 'block', 'hash', 'verification', 'blocks', 'track', 'mastercard', 'value']",,,[],2018-05-02 14:25:48+05:30,https://bcfocus.com/news/mastercard-files-a-patent-application-for-a-quick-blockchain-node-verification-system/7686/,,,,

Sri Lanka : Mastercard to transform Sri Lanka\'s digital payments landscape with Mastercard QR,"Leading News from Sri Lanka::* Mastercard to transform Sri Lanka's digital payments landscape with Mastercard QRThu, May 24, 2018, 12:26 pm SL Time, ColomboPage News Desk, Sri Lanka.May 24, Colombo: Mastercard unveiled Mastercard's Merchant Presented QR payment solution in Sri Lanka, a safe and secure Quick Response (QR) based mobile payments solution.The solution enables shoppers to safely pay using a mobile application with a standardized QR code support to scan the merchant-presented QR code, which works on smartphones. Ushering in a new era for digital payments in the island nation, Mastercard QR can easily be integrated into existing mobile payment solutions offered by financial service providers and works with existing Mastercard cards as well.""Mastercard is excited to bring Mastercard QR to Sri Lanka, one of its key focus markets in South Asia. Continuing to support the country's ongoing efforts to encourage adoption of cashless payments, Mastercard seeks to simplify access to digital payments for businesses and consumers through this fast, secure, convenient and cost-effective solution,"" said R. B. Santosh Kumar, Country Manager, Sri Lanka and Maldives, Mastercard.Mastercard QR enables merchants to accept Mastercard payments using a simple EMV Co standard QR code that merchants can display at their Point of Sale (POS) without the need for any physical equipment. They can also use a dynamic EMV Co QR code generated on the merchant's mobile device. It is a low cost and easy-to-deploy technology, designed to benefit every merchant, whether they are based in a major city or a remote area. Thus, it opens up a world of opportunities to small and micro merchants across the country who are challenged by a traditional terminal approach for payments.""The initial response on Mastercard QR from Mastercard's local customers and partners has been very encouraging. Mastercard is working together to integrate it into their existing systems. We look forward to seeing many more merchants and consumers availing the convenience and security of digital payments through solutions such as Mastercard QR,"" added Santosh.The release of the EMVCo QR Codes Specification in July 2017 has further propelled the proliferation of the interoperable QR Standards of QR Payments across Asia. These standards mean that merchants can now display a single QR code to accept different types of payments, and significantly simplifies the consumer and merchant experience in QR payments. Besides the successful launch in India in 2016, Mastercard is working closely with banks and non-banking financial service providers to roll this out in other countries like Thailand, Vietnam, Taiwan and Singapore.","Leading News from Sri Lanka::* Mastercard to transform Sri Lanka's digital payments landscape with Mastercard QRThu, May 24, 2018, 12:26 pm SL Time, ColomboPage News Desk, Sri Lanka.May 24, Colombo: Mastercard unveiled Mastercard's Merchant Presented QR payment solution in Sri Lanka, a safe and secure Quick Response (QR) based mobile payments solution.""Mastercard is excited to bring Mastercard QR to Sri Lanka, one of its key focus markets in South Asia.Mastercard QR enables merchants to accept Mastercard payments using a simple EMV Co standard QR code that merchants can display at their Point of Sale (POS) without the need for any physical equipment.The release of the EMVCo QR Codes Specification in July 2017 has further propelled the proliferation of the interoperable QR Standards of QR Payments across Asia.","['lanka', 'solution', 'digital', 'sri', 'lankas', 'payments', 'mobile', 'qr', 'transform', 'landscape', 'code', 'mastercard', 'merchants']",,,"['Gamini Gunaratna', 'Sri Lanka News Paper Lankapage.Com', 'Llc - Latest Hot News Sri Lanka']",,http://www.colombopage.com/archive_18A/May24_1527145008CH.php,,,,

Stock Investors Don't Care About 24% Earnings Growth,"It‰Ûªs not what have you done for me lately. For companies in the S&P 500 Index, it‰Ûªs what will you do for me next. And that‰Ûªs proving a thorny question for U.S. equity bulls.Another week of stellar earnings reports has gone by without any payoff in stocks. Even Friday‰Ûªs rally, the biggest in almost a month, couldn‰Ûªt turn the tide. Sure, Apple Inc. had its best week since Barack Obama‰Ûªs first presidential term, and Mastercard Inc. shrugged off a push by Amazon.com Inc. in online payments. But even as analysts raised S&P 500 profit forecasts for each of the next three years, the benchmark gauge for U.S. equities was flat.The issue is whether to believe the analysts. Companies could hardly be doing a better job of fattening profits or buying back stock at present. But forces have gathered that lead some investors to wonder if enthusiasm for the future isn‰Ûªt a little stretched.‰ÛÏPerfection is priced in,‰Ûù said Robert Parks, managing director at RJ O‰ÛªBrien & Associates LLC in Chicago. ‰ÛÏS&P earnings are spectacular, but it would be difficult to continue that, and that‰Ûªs what the market is worried about.‰ÛùEarnings Peak? Analysts don't see the pace of first-quarter EPS growth continuing Source: BloombergOne concern is profit margins, the difference between revenue and expenses. With the cost of everything going up, how long can U.S. companies keep sending dollars they get in sales to the bottom line? It‰Ûªs a creeping anxiety. Using earnings before interest and taxes, S&P 500 margins stand at 13.7 percent, according to Fundstrat‰Ûªs Thomas Lee. They reached a record 14.04 percent in December 2014.With the 10-year Treasury yield flirting with 3 percent, labor costs creeping higher and commodity prices up, anxiety about margin compression has swirled. Michael O‰ÛªRourke, JonesTrading‰Ûªs chief market strategist, said he heard budding anxiety about rising input costs in quarterly commentary from companies as diverse as Caterpillar Inc., 3M Co. and Paccar Inc.‰ÛÏAll of these costs now exist, and are rising in a way that they haven‰Ûªt for a decade or more,‰Ûù said Michael Shaoul, the head of Marketfield Asset Management. ‰ÛÏIt‰Ûªs too early to tell whether corporate management can pass them on.‰ÛùDespite a 6.6 percent gain in Alibaba and a 13 percent surge in Apple, the S&P 500 declined for a second week, slipping 0.2 percent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 49 points, while the Nasdaq 100 Index rose 1.7 percentMargin deterioration has the potential to terrify bulls because of how much earnings optimism is baked into the S&P 500‰Ûªs valuation. Even after falling 7.3 percent from its January record, the index still fetches a 20.5 times earnings in the last year. Looking forward, to projected 2018 earnings, the multiple falls to a more palatable 16.2. Based on 2019 expectations, it‰Ûªs a relatively cheap 15.3.Getting there won‰Ûªt be easy, however. S&P 500 companies are in the process of reporting profit growth of 24 percent in the first quarter, the most since 2010, and they must repeat that all year to hit analysts 2018‰Ûªs target of $158.30 a share. Then profits will have to rise an additional 10 percent in 2019 to hit that year‰Ûªs target.An increase in inflation is anticipated in those numbers, but probably not a rapid one, particularly in raw materials. General Motors Co.‰Ûªs costs tied to higher commodity prices will be up to $400 million higher than was expected in January, the company said last month. A $470 million increase in commodity costs is to blame for lower earnings in Ford Motor Co.‰Ûªs auto sector.Lee, Fundstrat‰Ûªs head of research, says there‰Ûªs nothing to worry about. Only four S&P 500 sectors -- tech, utilities, real estate and consumer discretionary -- have margins at or near record, he said in a note.

Mastercard looks to expand blockchain network of its own,"The payments conglomerate Mastercard is looking to enter the crypto space in a big way as it adds new nodes to its blockchain network. This was revealed in a patent application filed last Thursday with the U.S. Patent and Trademarks Office. Before long, cryptocurrencies could become a valid method of payment on Mastercard cards.The application describes a method which nodes can use to connect with and validate the content of a particular blockchain. The goal, according to Mastercard, is to boost the speed at which the nodes can get up to date. These nodes can also store a copy of the blockchain network‰Ûªs transaction history.Mastercard initially filed the application way back in October 2016. The application further clarifies that a blockchain can store thousands, millions or billions of transactions over a period of time in a huge number of different blocks. Additionally, the blockchain can in itself contain thousands, millions or billions of blocks. Each of these must be verified by the new node before the generation and addition of new blocks to the blockchain. Complex perhaps, but this statement demonstrates the commitment of Mastercard to blockchain technology.Mastercard goes on to describe the patent application in greater detail:‰ÛÏThe verification of such a large number of blocks may take a significant amount of time, during which new blocks may be added to the blockchain, further delaying the ability for the new node to participate ‰Û_ Thus, there is a need for a technical solution to increase the speed at which a blockchain may be navigated for verification thereof, which can thereby reduce the time required for a new node to begin participating in the blockchain.‰ÛùFor this to happen, the proposed system should include what are termed as ‰Û÷fast track flags‰Ûª that are included in block headers. According to Mastercard, these nodes would be able to use those flags to scan the blockchain‰Ûªs contents much faster. The filing also proposed the use of a specially configured blockchain that should act as a software counterpart to the aforementioned notes and help remove inefficiency.Note: Tokens on the Bitcoin Core (segwit) Chain are Referred to as BTC coins.

3 Big Takeaways From Mastercard's Latest Quarter,"Mastercard Inc. (NYSE:MA) shareholders have had a lot to cheer about this past year. During this time, the company has finalized key acquisitions, incorporated powerful security features into its payments networks, and won new deals with financial institutions and merchants. These moves powered Mastercard shares to a 65% gain over the past year, crushing the S&P 500's returns in the process.Judging by its fourth-quarter results, the good times don't look like they'll be ending anytime soon. When the company reported earnings at the end of last month, revenue rose to $3.3 billion, a 20% increase year over year, and adjusted earnings per share spiked to $1.14, a 33% increase year over year. The top- and bottom-line growth was driven by a rise in switched transactions, the number of times a Mastercard- or Maestro-branded card was utilized to make a purchase, to 17.7 billion, a 17% increase year over year. The number of Mastercard cards in circulation also grew to 2.4 billion, a 5% increase year over year.Mastercard Metrics Q4 2017 Q4 2016 Change Net revenue $3.31 billion $2.76 billion 20% Adjusted EPS $1.14 $0.86 33% Switched transactions 17.7 billion 15.2 billion 17% Circulated cards 2.43 billion 2.3 billion 5%Beyond solid growth, let's take a closer look at three other big takeaways from Mastercard's latest quarter: the impact of tax reform, more new deals, and strong growth in cross-border volume.""A very positive development""During the conference call, CFO Martina Hund-Mejean estimated that the total annual savings from the new tax legislation was ""in the ZIP code of $450 million."" CEO Ajay Banga called the Tax Cuts and Job Act a ""very positive development"" and noted three ways in which the company was planning to invest these new-found funds: (1) additional investments in the Center for Inclusive Growth, (2) an increase in retirement benefits for Mastercard employees; and (3) an acceleration in organic and inorganic investments and to return excess capital to shareholders.In 2014, Mastercard launched the Center for Inclusive Growth to advance economic mobility in the U.S. and abroad. With tax reform savings, Mastercard hopes to give $100 million to the center in each of the next five years. While not much color was given concerning what these additional funds would pay for, Banga did say ""among our initial efforts will be training programs for U.S. workers to help create the workforce for tomorrow.""For its employees, Banga said, ""While we've always been an active and generous contributor to our employee benefits, we're going to take this opportunity to enhance our employer match to 10% for defined contribution retirement plans."" Later, Hund-Mejean added, ""that is a permanent adjustment ... not just a one-time thing.""Finally, Banga said that Mastercard would be looking to invest for growth ""in areas that are aligned with our business strategy, digital infrastructure, Fast ACH, data analytics, those spaces."" Later, he singled out VocaLink as a likely source for additional investment, as the company explored ways to increase its Fast ACH capabilities and global coverage.New dealsMastercard announced plenty of new deals it had secured in its conference call. On the retail co-brand card side, Mastercard announced it had extended its agreement with Bass Pro Shops to include its and newly acquired Cabela's consumer card portfolios. Mastercard also renewed its deal with KeyCorp Bank for its consumer and commercial credit and debit card portfolios. Internationally, Mastercard announced a number of new deals with European, Chinese, and Latin American banks. Banga also noted that, in India, the government finally published discount rates which should ""spur merchant acceptance and continued transaction growth over the next few years.""Once again, Mastercard credited the services it rolls up in its other revenues segment for playing a big role in landing these new deals. For instance, Banga said KeyBank subscribed to various Mastercard services, including AI authentication tools, loyalty platform management, and processing services. ING Groep's subsidiary in Italy uses Mastercard Installments, a program that allows consumers to make a series of extended payments for larger purchases.These examples point out how Mastercard's other revenues segment can continue to demonstrate solid growth. In the fourth quarter, revenue in the category rose to $851 million, a 17% increase year over year. With more promised investments in these service categories coming from tax savings, Mastercard could see even more growth from this under-appreciated business division in the future.Strong cross-border growthCross-border volume fees are what Mastercard collects for transactions where the merchants are located in different countries than the origin of the card issuers. In the fourth quarter, cross-border revenue rose to $1.12 billion, a 23% increase year over year. Banga said several factors went into the strong growth seen in this category.For starters, Mastercard's cross-border capabilities were credited as a factor in helping the company secure a deal with Banco Davivienda in Colombia. The majority of Mastercard's accelerated revenue growth in cross-border volume came from Europe. This had to do with macro factors, like extended European holidays and an in increase in intra- and inter-European travel, but also from new deals on the continent. Finally, and perhaps most interesting, is that Mastercard believes it got a boost in cross-border volumes from consumers funding cryptocurrency exchanges with their credit cards!A priceless addition to a portfolioMastercard benefits from a number of long-term tailwinds, like the digitization of money and a ""network effect"" moat that only grows wider as more merchants and consumers use the payment network. When other nearer-term catalysts such as tax reform, strong cross-border volume growth, and newly won deals are added into the equation, Mastercard quickly becomes one of the top ideas for any investor's portfolio. Granted, this growth doesn't come cheap. Based on its full-year earnings per share of $4.59, the company trades at a steep valuation with a P/E ratio of 37.5. Mastercard has never looked cheap based on its P/E multiple though, but that hasn't stopped it from skyrocketing in value. From its split-adjusted IPO price of $3.90, Mastercard has risen an astounding 4,400% since going public in 2006. While that's an incredible run, based on its latest quarter it doesn't appear that ride will be ending anytime soon.","The number of Mastercard cards in circulation also grew to 2.4 billion, a 5% increase year over year.In the fourth quarter, revenue in the category rose to $851 million, a 17% increase year over year.In the fourth quarter, cross-border revenue rose to $1.12 billion, a 23% increase year over year.The majority of Mastercard's accelerated revenue growth in cross-border volume came from Europe.While that's an incredible run, based on its latest quarter it doesn't appear that ride will be ending anytime soon.","['deals', 'takeaways', 'crossborder', 'latest', 'banga', 'increase', 'billion', 'company', 'mastercards', 'quarter', 'growth', 'tax', 'revenue', 'mastercard', 'big']",,,"['Matthew Cochrane', 'As An Economic Crimes Detective', 'Matthew Focuses On Helping Others Becoming Victims Of Fraud', 'Scams.

Visa and Mastercard need more than a single button to beat PayPal,"Visa and Mastercard have recently announced they will combine their Visa Checkout and Masterpass payment options into a single button. American Express and Discover Financial Services will also join the project, and all companies have agreed with the framework EMVCo proposed.EMVCo is the standards body for the payments industry, at the forefront of transactional security. This endeavor, dubbed a ‰ÛÏshiny new button‰Ûù or a ‰ÛÏnew deal,"" is a step forward for payment systems.Although Visa and Mastercard lead overall in online payments, in some countries such as Germany, PayPal even surpasses them in terms of transaction volumes. PayPal is also a convenient payment option for the digital consumers, and it provides a unique and fast option from anywhere in the world. However, are all these payment methods secure enough? PayPal and card solutions are more or less equally vulnerable to online fraud. This comes at a time where e-commerce fraud is up by 30% compared with last year.Bloomberg NewsThe ever-growing number of online frauds, and the increased awareness of data theft, combined with the recent data privacy scandals, are pushing consumers toward (even) more secure forms of payments. This might be the ideal time for Visa, Mastercard, Amex and Discover to focusing on providing a seamless and even safer online experience to consumers.Let‰Ûªs have a look at what this endeavor by these big payments players could mean, and what would be the requirements to make it a success.A unified ‰ÛÏbutton‰Ûù for all companies Visa, Mastercard, Amex and Discover, will help them fight the NASCAR effect , offering a united front when facing other competitors like PayPal, Amazon or Apple Pay.At the same time, these card giants are the most experienced when it comes security standards, constantly improving their technology. The new proposed method via tokenization, providing consumers with a digital ID, is more secure and is also perceived as more secure. It could simplify online payments for consumers, issuers and merchants.This unified method of payment would give online consumers the security reassurance they need in order to make online payments confident that they are protected against new cyber threats.This welcome initiative still has to face a few challenges and would need to meet some requirements in order to be fully accepted by consumers.Communication and new checkout options: This was a key reason for the failure of Visa Checkout and Masterpass. These companies have massive networks giving them access to more than enough people to make this a success. They just need to promote the new method more proactively.Offer support to end users: This is key to improve end-user satisfaction, without which this new unified form of payment will fail. Card network usually communicate exclusively with banks and financial institution; they will need to communicate directly with merchants (and card holders!) to make their solution widespread.Localization: In order to offer a good end-user experience and make sure this solution is relevant worldwide, the card companies need to take into account local brands that have tremendous influence on local markets (Alipay and Webmoney, to name a couple).Avoiding repeating past mistakes will not be enough. Visa, Mastercard, Amex and Discover need to bring some added value that could trump PayPal‰Ûªs already end-user-friendly solutions.Card networks are usually leaders in standards in terms of security (PCI DSS, MATCH, etc.). This solution offering tokenized digital payments would make it nearly hackproof, providing users with a digital ID effectively replacing cardholder information. This would make this solution cutting edge in terms of cybersecurity. It‰Ûªs true that ApplePay is also using tokenization, which is a plus, but it is network-based and limited internationally. A truly global network could make a difference.Another plus for this unified payment method would be to fully use EMVco biometrics solutions like fingerprint, voice and facial recognition. Improvements in this area could place this ‰ÛÏnew deal‰Ûù from the card companies ahead of the game.Finally, all companies (Visa, Mastercard, Amex and Discover) should take into account local competitors, as online shoppers may have different needs based on their regional market.This initiative is a step in the right direction to modernize digital transactions, but there are some obstacles to be mindful of on the way to success.","Visa and Mastercard have recently announced they will combine their Visa Checkout and Masterpass payment options into a single button.Although Visa and Mastercard lead overall in online payments, in some countries such as Germany, PayPal even surpasses them in terms of transaction volumes.A unified ‰ÛÏbutton‰Ûù for all companies Visa, Mastercard, Amex and Discover, will help them fight the NASCAR effect , offering a united front when facing other competitors like PayPal, Amazon or Apple Pay.Visa, Mastercard, Amex and Discover need to bring some added value that could trump PayPal‰Ûªs already end-user-friendly solutions.This solution offering tokenized digital payments would make it nearly hackproof, providing users with a digital ID effectively replacing cardholder information.","['card', 'need', 'visa', 'button', 'discover', 'companies', 'single', 'digital', 'paypal', 'payments', 'beat', 'mastercard', 'online', 'payment']",,,['Adriana Iordan'],2018-05-24 00:01:10.090000-04:00,https://www.paymentssource.com/opinion/visa-and-mastercard-need-more-than-a-single-button-to-beat-paypal,,,,
Mastercard Hints at Plans for Blockchain Settlement System,"Mastercard may be looking to integrate blockchain into its payments infrastructure.The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) published a new application from the financial giant this week that outlines a solution for a ""uniform settlement system"" ‰ÛÒ one that would help ease some of the friction involved with business-to-business payments. Specific issues cited in the application include growing data storage demands and the overall volume of transactions.Notably, Mastercard suggests in the text that such a system could include a blockchain-based ledger of transactions.As the application explains:""In some embodiments, the ledger may be a blockchain configured to store the associated data. ... In the system, the data values may include the purchase orders, invoices, transaction data, and other data stored in the ledger as discussed herein.""Mastercard clarified that the blockchain would be able to automatically note all changes made to the ledger, creating a verifiable and immutable record of all data. As a result, malicious users would be unable to modify transactions in the system.The entry represents the latest intellectual property play by Mastercard that invokes blockchain, in a series of applications that goes back to 2014. Most recently, in August, the USPTO published an application related to cryptocurrency-based refunds.Disclosure: MasterCard is an investor in CoinDesk's parent company, Digital Currency Group.Mastercard image via ShutterstockThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

"MLB, Mastercard Deliver Augmented Reality Message During World Series","Game 4 of the World Series featured some good old postseason baseball with a tech-savvy twist.While the Los Angeles Dodgers pulled out all the stops to even the Series against the Houston Astros at two games apiece, Astros shortstop Carlos Correa had a message for every fan at Minute Maid Park with MLB‰Ûªs Ballpark app installed on their phones.

"Payment Stocks Visa, Mastercard, Square, Green Dot, AmEx Near Buys","Payment stocks have been showing their worth lately, with buying opportunities in the finance sector subgroup aplenty. Your stocks to watch this week are five payment-related names that might be worth putting into your portfolio, in addition to your wallet: Mastercard (MA), Visa (V), Green Dot (GDOT), American Express (AXP) and Square (SQ).XPayment Stocks Are StandoutsMastercard leads payment stocks with a highest-possible IBD Composite Rating of 99, while Visa's stock earns a 97 and Green Dot has a 96. Square follows with a 91 and American Express with an 88. Top stocks typically have high Composite Ratings as they launch big runs.These five stocks are among the leaders in the broader finance sector, with the Finance-Credit Card/Payment Processors industry group ranking No. 50 out of the 197 industry groups that IBD tracks.MastercardMastercard is showing strength after breaking out past a 183.83 flat-base buy point on earnings. Since chasing a stock isn't ideal, it's best to make buys when shares are no more than 5% above a buy point. Mastercard closed Friday slightly extended from a buy range that runs up to 193.02, but the stock pulled back 0.6% to 192.12 on Monday.VisaLike Mastercard, Visa broke out of a base on its latest quarterly earnings report. The 125.54 buy point that the Dow Jones component cleared was from a base-on-base pattern. Visa dipped 0.5% to 131.21 on Monday after closing Friday at the very top of its 5% buy range.Green DotGreen Dot's 15% post-earnings gain Thursday fueled shares past a 69.47 buy point from a flat base. Shares rose 1% to 72.73 on Monday, near the top of the buy range.Green Dot sells prepaid cards and debit cards. The stock has made quite a comeback in recent years, and only surpassed its all-time high, set in 2011, just a few months ago.American ExpressAmerican Express is vying for a breakout of its own, with shares coming close to a 103.06 handle entry intraday Friday. AmEx backed away from that level, closing at 101.42. Shares dipped 0.1% on Monday. But the stock has had upward momentum since a recent rebound off the 50-day line. AmEx, like Visa, is a Dow Jones component.SquareSquare, one of the big winners from 2017, fell 0.8% Monday to 54.28, still in range from a 52.60 buy point from a double-bottom base. Shares are now 7% below their all-time high of 58.46 on March 21.PayPal, PagSeguroMeanwhile, PayPal (PYPL) is consolidating since hitting an all-time high in late January. Shares are 8% below that level after retaking the 50-day moving average Thursday. And once-hot IPO PagSeguro (PAGS) is well below its late-March peak and its newly formed 50-day line.YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Trump Tweets Lifts Stock Futures; Good News For These Techs?Top Payments Stock Breaks Out, Joining These 3 Peers In Buy ZonesApple's Big Run Teaches Crucial Lesson For Investing SuccessStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth StocksDow Jones Industrial Average And Dow Stocks: News And AnalysisBanks And Financial Stocks: Latest News And Analysis","XPayment Stocks Are StandoutsMastercard leads payment stocks with a highest-possible IBD Composite Rating of 99, while Visa's stock earns a 97 and Green Dot has a 96.MastercardMastercard is showing strength after breaking out past a 183.83 flat-base buy point on earnings.Since chasing a stock isn't ideal, it's best to make buys when shares are no more than 5% above a buy point.VisaLike Mastercard, Visa broke out of a base on its latest quarterly earnings report.Green DotGreen Dot's 15% post-earnings gain Thursday fueled shares past a 69.47 buy point from a flat base.","['high', 'shares', 'jones', 'square', 'visa', 'stock', 'dot', 'mastercard', 'buys', 'near', 'buy', 'amex', 'green', 'stocks', 'payment', 'big', 'point']",,,"[""Investor'S Business Daily"", 'Alissa Coram']",2018-05-14 13:17:22-07:00,https://www.investors.com/news/visa-mastercard-square-green-dot-amex-top-payment-stocks/,,,,
Why Mastercard‰Ûªs a Better Bet Than Visa,"Mastercard (MA) and Visa (V) have outperformed the market in 2018, but Mastercard's gained twice as much as Visa.Illustration: Getty ImagesThat makes perfect sense, writes EvercoreISI's David Togut.

"MasterCard Partners, Facebook, Banks to Help Nigerian SMEs on Digital Payments","By Dipo OlowookereMasterCard has announced its intention to help business owners in Nigeria go beyond cash transactions to accepting QR payments.In order to achieve this, the firm is working with Ecobank and Zenith Bank in its pilot scheme called the Masterpass QR bot.This initiative will use Facebook Messenger to provide technology to small businesses in Africa and Asia to drive affordable acceptance of electronic and mobile payments.The pilot in Nigeria is the beginning of a larger plan by the two companies to include more businesses into the digital economy.According to research done by The Fletcher School and MasterCard Center for Inclusive Growth, of the $301 billion of funds flow from consumers to businesses in Nigeria, 98 percent is still based on cash.‰ÛÏEvery business owner is looking for ways to increase sales and draw new customers into their stores.‰ÛÏBy offering QR-based digital payments, smaller retailers can achieve these goals and create greater customer stickiness with little to no investment beyond the phone they already have,‰Ûù said Jorn Lambert, Executive Vice President, Digital Channels and Regions, MasterCard.‰ÛÏMasterpass QR opens up new commerce channels for these merchants and enables them to create auditable transaction records. These advances open doors to other financial tools and products such as loans to drive added business growth,‰Ûù Lambert added.To get started, businesses can send a request to the bot to enable QR payments, receive approval from the bank, set up an account and start accepting digital payments in a fast, simple and secure manner. Once the account set up process is complete, business owners can print and display the QR code in their stores or save the code on their phones.Customers can pay by either scanning the code from their smartphone or by entering the merchant ID associated with the QR code into their feature phone.‰ÛÏBrands and developers around the world are turning to messaging to connect with the 1.3 billion people who use Messenger each month,‰Ûù said Kahina Van Dyke, Director of Payments and Financial Services Partnerships at Facebook. ‰ÛÏWe are pleased that MasterCard is developing a service on the Messenger Platform to help small merchants use messaging to manage their business and connect with their customers.‰ÛùLaunched in 2016, Masterpass QR provides people with any type of mobile phone the ability to safely accept and make in-person purchases without cash or a plastic card. It provides greater choice in payments and complements MasterCard‰Ûªs investment in contactless payments to provide merchants of all sizes ‰ÛÒ from international chains to individual shop owners and street vendors ‰ÛÒ a fast, secure and inexpensive way to accept payments.‰ÛÏIn line with our goal to serve 100 million Africans by the end of 2020, Ecobank is delighted to collaborate with Facebook and MasterCard to enable underserved and unbanked micro-merchants with the opportunity to open an Ecobank account almost immediately and begin to receive instant payments using Ecobank Masterpass QR on the Facebook Messenger platform.‰ÛÏMicro merchants in Nigeria are already benefiting from Masterpass QR and will soon be in 32 markets across Africa, enabling them to move away from cash. That is true economic empowerment,‰Ûù said Patrick Akinwuntan, Group Executive, Consumer Bank, Ecobank Group.‰ÛÏOur Bank is partnering with Facebook and MasterCard to introduce Masterpass QR as a means of driving financial inclusion and creating a new payment ecosystem for MSMEs and consumers,‰Ûù said Mr Peter Amangbo, MD/CEO of Zenith Bank Plc.‰ÛÏThis initiative will help us encourage financial inclusion within the country in line with the strategic thrust of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN). Buyers and sellers now meet and conclude transactions in-store, online and on social media, so we are ensuring payments can also be made on these platforms via QR codes, without having to log onto other solutions or even take a break from what you are doing on Facebook,‰Ûù he added.","By Dipo OlowookereMasterCard has announced its intention to help business owners in Nigeria go beyond cash transactions to accepting QR payments.In order to achieve this, the firm is working with Ecobank and Zenith Bank in its pilot scheme called the Masterpass QR bot.This initiative will use Facebook Messenger to provide technology to small businesses in Africa and Asia to drive affordable acceptance of electronic and mobile payments.‰ÛÏMasterpass QR opens up new commerce channels for these merchants and enables them to create auditable transaction records.That is true economic empowerment,‰Ûù said Patrick Akinwuntan, Group Executive, Consumer Bank, Ecobank Group.","['banks', 'facebook', 'ecobank', 'business', 'masterpass', 'messenger', 'help', 'digital', 'payments', 'nigeria', 'partners', 'nigerian', 'bank', 'qr', 'smes', 'mastercard', 'merchants']",,,['Dipo Olowookere'],3/1/18 0:00,https://www.businesspost.ng/2018/03/01/mastercard-partners-facebook-banks-help-nigerian-smes-digital-payments/,,,,
Mastercard Offers Financial Tools For Gig Workers From Uber Drivers To Dog Walkers,"With up to a third of Americans working irregular mostly part-time jobs in what has been labeled the gig economy, Mastercard sees a need, and an opportunity, in meeting new payment challenges.Employers like Uber and Lyft can pay their drivers effectively in real-time and multiple times per day, said Craig Vosburg, president for Mastercard North America. After all, he added, the drivers are experiencing expenses in real-time so why should they have to wait for weeks to get paid?Photo by Tom GroenfeldtMastercard says it can ‰ÛÏaddress the challenges of workers who juggle multiple jobs, variable paychecks and inconsistent benefits.‰ÛùThe program called the Inclusive Futures Project has three parts ‰ÛÓ digital solutions to manage finances and speed payments; government services for greater innovation and efficiency; and smart cities for a digitally inclusive future according to the company‰Ûªs announcement.The company has already established itself as a provider of electronic payments in areas as widely separated as South African welfare payments and salaries to government works in Egypt, speeding payments and bypassing middlemen and officials who may in the past have skimmed payments that passed through them.Another aspect of its program is to provide payment history and help in budgeting unpredictable cash flows. Mastercard is in a pilot with Care.com, a platform to connect care givers with families looking for care, ranging from pet care or house watching to child care or senior care.‰ÛÏCaregivers represent a huge portion of the gig economy and like most gig workers, they frequently work for more than one employer which can make personal financial management challenging,‰Ûù explained Bryan O‰ÛªMalley, vice president and general manager of payments business operations. ‰ÛÏCare.com is committed to helping caregivers access professional benefits and build their careers and we believe a financial tool like this will help drive financial inclusion for this critical workforce, providing more insight into overall financial health and leading to better money management.‰ÛùCaregiver schedules and payments can vary widely and are determined by the caregiver and the family or families for whom they work, he added.","With up to a third of Americans working irregular mostly part-time jobs in what has been labeled the gig economy, Mastercard sees a need, and an opportunity, in meeting new payment challenges.Employers like Uber and Lyft can pay their drivers effectively in real-time and multiple times per day, said Craig Vosburg, president for Mastercard North America.After all, he added, the drivers are experiencing expenses in real-time so why should they have to wait for weeks to get paid?Mastercard is in a pilot with Care.com, a platform to connect care givers with families looking for care, ranging from pet care or house watching to child care or senior care.‰ÛÏCaregivers represent a huge portion of the gig economy and like most gig workers, they frequently work for more than one employer which can make personal financial management challenging,‰Ûù explained Bryan O‰ÛªMalley, vice president and general manager of payments business operations.","['uber', 'widely', 'offers', 'tools', 'drivers', 'gig', 'financial', 'workers', 'dog', 'payments', 'work', 'program', 'care', 'mastercard', 'walkers', 'realtime']",,,['Tom Groenfeldt'],1/26/18 0:00,https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomgroenfeldt/2018/01/26/mastercard-offers-financial-tools-for-gig-workers-from-uber-to-dog-walkers/,,,,

Online biometric payments brought to Europe by Mastercard,"What do you think of biometric authentication? Would you happily give up passwords and use a new method?In early 2018 Mastercard is set to launch a new capability via which European shoppers will be able to use biometric technology for the authentication of online payments.This project will involve both fingerprint scanning and facial recognition technology, both of which society has become familiar with through the widespread use of smartphones.Mastercard is proving to be at the tip of spearhead of biometric technology for payments, having been engaged in research and implementation. The Mastercard Identity Check offering is active across the globe and is compatible with online banking and shopping.As reported by Finextra, Javier Perez, president, Mastercard Europe, says: ‰ÛÏBiometric technologies perfectly match consumers‰Ûª expectations of getting the secure payment solutions of tomorrow, in line with the increased digitalisation of lifestyles. This can significantly benefit consumers, retailers and banks by improving the purchase experience and better securing the transaction.‰ÛùThere has been growing research pointing toward consumers preferring the idea of using biometric authentication over remembering passwords, a global security weak point that is constantly leveraged by malicious actors.Other work conducted by Mastercard in the biometrics space includes the launch of a biometric credit card, in this instance the process requires a fingerprint. Mastercard trialled this capability in South Africa with successful results, with the fingerprint recognition technology built into the card itself. Like with passwords, pin numbers have also been problematic when people are trusted to protect and manage them.In addition to the biometric credit card, Mastercard also launched the concept of the biometric selfie for payments, this move also targeted Europe in 2017. The UK is included in the 12 countries the project was pushed out to, while the payments giant continued to trial it in countries like the United States, Canada and the Netherlands.Working with Oxford University, Mastercard conducted and presented research that found 93 per cent of UK consumers prepared to take up biometrics if it meant passwords could be replaced, uncovering a clear path for innovation.","What do you think of biometric authentication?In early 2018 Mastercard is set to launch a new capability via which European shoppers will be able to use biometric technology for the authentication of online payments.Mastercard is proving to be at the tip of spearhead of biometric technology for payments, having been engaged in research and implementation.Mastercard trialled this capability in South Africa with successful results, with the fingerprint recognition technology built into the card itself.In addition to the biometric credit card, Mastercard also launched the concept of the biometric selfie for payments, this move also targeted Europe in 2017.","['europe', 'card', 'biometric', 'brought', 'authentication', 'payments', 'technology', 'research', 'fingerprint', 'consumers', 'mastercard', 'online', 'passwords']",,,['Tom Ball'],2018-01-23 16:48:15+01:00,https://www.cbronline.com/news/online-biometric-payments-mastercard,,,,
How Recent Acquisitions Are Powering Mastercard's Growth,"It's hard to think of many companies better suited to illustrate the long-term power of compound interest than Mastercard Inc (NYSE:MA). From its split-adjusted IPO price of $3.90 in May 2006 to its current price of $153.40, Mastercard has returned an incredible 3,933% to shareholders since going public. Even recent investors in the company have done well as the stock price is up 48.6% year-to-date.What powers Mastercard's incredible returns is its incredible business model: Essentially Mastercard acts as a digital toll road of sorts for payments being made with a card bearing its logo. When a bank-issued card with the Mastercard emblem is used to make a purchase, the funds travel from the bank to the merchant using the company's network. Mastercard receives small fees based on the number of transactions and the dollar amount of each transaction.Supplementing its core business is Mastercard's Other Revenues segment. In the company's third quarter, Other Revenues grew to $747 million, a 21% year-over-year increase. Other Revenues is money Mastercard makes beyond its core payment network business, mostly consisting of services it can offer to merchants and financial institutions like fraud detection, reward program management, consulting, and data analytics.While Mastercard develops many of these services' capabilities in-house, it also depends on acquisitions to bolster its skills and competencies. This year alone, Mastercard has finalized two such acquisitions and announced another one. Let's take a closer look at three of the companies Mastercard has recently acquired to see what they bring to the table and how they might impact Mastercard going forward.An APT decisionIn April 2015, Mastercard entered an agreement to acquire Applied Predictive Technologies (APT) for $600 million. APT is a cloud-based analytics provider that helps companies optimize marketing and merchandising operations. Mastercard CFO Martina Hund-Mejean calls them ""a test-and-learn"" platform that allow companies ""to make much faster decisions in kind of a sandbox way."" What that means on a granular level is if a retail location is thinking about changing a product's price or, even, shelf placement, it can use APT's platform to get an idea how that change would play out in real life as opposed to testing the new strategy in a store first.So far, the company has signed up more than half of its domestic customers for its analytics platforms like APT. At the company's recent Investor Day, Mastercard's President of North American Markets Craig Vosburg said:""Our data and analytics services, which includes everything from macro-economic data to portfolio-specific data to APT and the kinds of things we do with APT on an individual counter-party basis to look at, test and evaluate the effectiveness of different campaigns, different investment options so the decisions can be made on a more-informed basis and increase the ROI of those decisions. We've got more than 60% of our customers in North America using those kinds of services.""A Nu way of preventing credit card fraudIn March, Mastercard entered an agreement to acquire NuData Security, a company that creates digital identities for consumers to prevent fraud. NuDetect, NuData's flagship product, uses passive biometrics to create this identity and then uses that identity's profile to authenticate users before they make an online or mobile transaction. Passive biometrics includes everything from how individuals type on a keyboard and how they interact with their smartphone's touch screen.Authenticating users in this manner, as opposed to asking people to remember a million different passwords or asking them annoying security questions (e.g. What was your favorite soda flavor in seventh grade?*) ensures a seamless customer experience. In the company's first-quarter conference call, transcribed by S&P Global Market Intelligence, CEO Ajay Banga talked about the increasing importance a security platform like NuData will play as the world becomes more connected:""We also acquired NuData Security, whose technology helps businesses detect and prevent online and mobile fraud based on understanding how end-users interact with devices ... The technology assesses, scores and learns from each transaction to help merchants and issuers make near real-time authorization decisions. And as the Internet of Things continues to grow with whose ever estimate you believe, it could be up to 50 billion connected devices by 2020. The point here is integrating NuData's technology into our layered security strategy will help consumers pay safely and conveniently however and whenever they choose to do so.""A Bright(erion) ideaMastercard's most recent acquisition hasn't even been finalized yet, but this past summer an agreement was made to acquire Brighterion, Inc. Brighterion is a software company specializing in AI. The idea is that Brighterion will be incorporated into Mastercard's existing AI suite of products, enhancing both security and consumer convenience in one fell swoop.In Mastercard's second-quarter conference call, Banga stated he believed Brighterion would allow Mastercard's AI-based programs to make more accurate real-time decisions when determining if purchases were fraudulent. At its Investor Day, management stated Brighterion had been partnering with Mastercard for years, giving the company confidence the deal would be beneficial. Ajay Bhalla, Mastercard's President of Security Solutions, even added the two were ""working on some very new, cool technologies for our customers.""Complementary parts to a comprehensive wholeMastercard's strategy of using a number of bolt-on additions to augment the services it accounts for in Other Revenues appears to be working. None of the acquisitions, by themselves, are game-changers or seem to cost an excessive amount of money. As far as I can tell, the $920 million it spent on VocaLink remains its largest acquisition since going public.Yet, taken together, the total is greater than the sum of its parts. Not only did revenue in the segment increase by 21% year-to-date, these services seem to be winning Mastercard new deals. In the second-quarter conference call, after announcing several new deals, Banga said, ""In each of these deals, our innovative solutions and value-added services were key differentiators for us."" If these services' revenues continue to increase by double-digit percentages while helping Mastercard win new deals, then acquisitions like APT, NuData, and Brighterion are easily worth their cost of admission.* Root beer","Even recent investors in the company have done well as the stock price is up 48.6% year-to-date.Supplementing its core business is Mastercard's Other Revenues segment.While Mastercard develops many of these services' capabilities in-house, it also depends on acquisitions to bolster its skills and competencies.In Mastercard's second-quarter conference call, Banga stated he believed Brighterion would allow Mastercard's AI-based programs to make more accurate real-time decisions when determining if purchases were fraudulent.Ajay Bhalla, Mastercard's President of Security Solutions, even added the two were ""working on some very new, cool technologies for our customers.""","['apt', 'price', 'services', 'decisions', 'revenues', 'recent', 'company', 'brighterion', 'mastercards', 'growth', 'powering', 'mastercard', 'acquisitions', 'security']",,,"['Matthew Cochrane', 'As An Economic Crimes Detective', 'Matthew Focuses On Helping Others Becoming Victims Of Fraud', 'Scams.

Mastercard Puts Another Great Year in the Books,"The battle among payment network providers has come down to a two-company race, and Mastercard (NYSE:MA) wants to cross the finish line first. Despite a history of lagging behind its archrival, Mastercard is fighting hard to surpass its biggest industry peer, and its mix of strategic vision and execution has served the company well recently.Coming into Thursday's fourth-quarter financial report, Mastercard investors had high hopes for a strong finish to 2017, setting the stage for further advances in 2018. The company didn't disappoint on either score, and with strong economic conditions taking hold worldwide, the prospects for payment processing growth have never looked better. Let's look more closely at Mastercard and what it's likely to experience in the coming year.Mastercard charges aheadMastercard's fourth-quarter results showed accelerating gains in several key metrics. Sales were up 20% to $3.31 billion, which was even better than the 18% gains that investors had expected to see, and that Mastercard put up in the third quarter. Net income was down sharply on a GAAP basis due to one-time impacts from tax reform, but after accounting for those hits, adjusted income of $1.2 billion worked out to adjusted earnings of $1.14 per share, topping the consensus forecast for $1.12 per share.Tax reform dealt a hit to Mastercard in the short run. The company took a charge of $873 million, or $0.82 per share, stemming from the provisions of the new tax laws, which included deemed repatriation tax on foreign earnings and revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities.Yet looking at Mastercard's fundamental business, things continued to look good. Gross dollar volume growth accelerated to 13%, coming in at $1.4 trillion, and switched transactions rose by 17% to 17.7 billion. Cross-border volumes were up 17% in local currency terms. Acquisitions added about 3 percentage points to overall revenue growth, driven largely by Vocalink. The company reported a greater than 10% rise in the number of outstanding Mastercard credit, charge, debit, and prepaid cards in circulation, amounting to a total of 2.4 billion cards when you add in Maestro-branded products.Operating expense discipline was also a key driver for Mastercard's success. Adjusting for special items, the card giant saw a 17% rise in operating costs, lagging behind the pace of sales growth and thereby boosting margin figures. Lower effective tax rates should help to bolster those gains going forward.As we've seen repeatedly, international operations showed stronger growth than U.S. business. Gross dollar volume jumped 15% in local currency terms compared to 9% growth domestically, and purchase volume growth showed a similar 15% to 10% comparison. Worldwide, Mastercard has more than triple the number of cards outstanding than it does in the U.S. market, and the card company's overseas exposure looks poised to remain essential in driving overall growth.Can Mastercard have a great 2018?CEO Ajay Banga expressed his satisfaction at Mastercard's results. ""We're pleased to have finished 2017 with strong results for the quarter and full year,"" Banga said, ""driven by the solid execution of our strategy."" The CEO also noted that ongoing investments in digital initiatives as well as safety and security measures are paying off with new business and further growth.Mastercard also continues to consider its own shares to be a smart investment. It paid about $1 billion to purchase 6.9 million shares of its stock during the fourth quarter, and after the end of the period, the company spent another $287 million to buy back 1.8 million shares during the month of January. That still leaves about $5 billion remaining under existing repurchase authorizations thanks to the recent $4 billion boost in December, leaving Mastercard with plenty of room for further buyback activity in 2018.Mastercard investors were happy with how the company did, and the stock jumped more than 3% in pre-market trading following the announcement. With good conditions worldwide, Mastercard's efforts to capture as much of the growth of the payment network industry as possible have been paying off well, and that seems likely to persist throughout 2018 and beyond.","The battle among payment network providers has come down to a two-company race, and Mastercard (NYSE:MA) wants to cross the finish line first.Let's look more closely at Mastercard and what it's likely to experience in the coming year.Gross dollar volume growth accelerated to 13%, coming in at $1.4 trillion, and switched transactions rose by 17% to 17.7 billion.Gross dollar volume jumped 15% in local currency terms compared to 9% growth domestically, and purchase volume growth showed a similar 15% to 10% comparison.Mastercard investors were happy with how the company did, and the stock jumped more than 3% in pre-market trading following the announcement.","['books', 'million', 'puts', 'great', 'worldwide', 'billion', 'company', 'mastercards', 'growth', 'volume', 'tax', 'strong', 'mastercard']",,,"['Dan Caplinger', ""Dan Caplinger Has Been A Contract Writer For The Motley Fool Since As The Fool'S Director Of Investment Planning"", 'Dan Oversees Much Of The Personal-Finance', 'Investment-Planning Content Published Daily On Fool.Com.

This Week In Credit Card News: Card Companies Entering Gun Control Debate; Why We Like Airline Cards,"Banks, Credit Card Companies Explore Ways to Monitor Gun PurchasesBanks and credit card companies are discussing ways to identify purchases of guns in their payment systems, a move that could be a prelude to restricting such transactions. The financial companies have explored creating a new credit card code for firearms dealers, similar to how they code restaurants or department stores. Another idea would require merchants to share information about specific firearm products consumers are buying. Such data could allow banks to restrict purchases at certain businesses or monitor them. [The Wall Street Journal]Why Airline Credit Cards Have an Enduring AppealSo what accounts for the continued appeal of the airline credit card, and who ought to have one? Some things that have always been true about these cards remain so: If you travel a lot on the same airline and spend a lot of money in your everyday life, earning the same reward currency when you travel and when you're using your card can help you quickly earn more and better free trips. But things have also changed. In addition to the miles, many of the mileage cards now come with privileges. You might get a free checked bag. Or you can board your flight in the fifth group instead of the seventh, thereby getting space for your carry-on in the overhead bin. [The New York Times]Mobile Banking Apps Among Most Used by Americans31% of consumers use mobile banking apps the most. This puts such apps behind only social media apps (55%) and weather apps (33%). Almost half (46%) of consumers have increased their mobile banking usage in the last year. This share includes almost two-thirds (62%) of millennials. Additionally, the Citi survey revealed that 81% of consumers are now using mobile banking nine days a month.

The technology advancement allows people to register their fingerprint onto their biometric card from the comfort of their home. Simplifying the registration process will help speed adoption of biometrics by issuers and consumers alike.

Fiserv Offers Mastercard Decision Intelligence,"Fiserv, a provider of financial services technology, announced news on Tuesday (March 6) that it is now offering Mastercard Decision Intelligence, a fraud detection service.In a press release, Fiserv said financial companies working with Fiserv will be able to access the service, which will help them increase the accuracy of real-time transaction approvals, reduce the number of false declines and improve the overall cardholder experience.‰ÛÏMinimizing the risk of financial losses while avoiding declining genuine consumer transactions requires a delicate balance,‰Ûù said Patrick Davie, VP of Card Services at Fiserv, in the press release. ‰ÛÏFalse declines can damage the relationship with cardholders, so evaluating multiple factors, including information about the consumer, merchant and issuer, throughout the shopping experience can enhance that cardholder experience and approve more genuine transactions, without increasing risk.‰ÛùAccording to the company, it‰Ûªs the first processor to provide Mastercard Decision Intelligence to financial institution clients. The platform relies on artificial intelligence to offer a predictive score by applying thousands of data points and modeling techniques to each transaction, which helps issuers make a more informed authorization decision.Fiserv‰Ûªs research shows that the number of active cards after two or more false-positive denials declines by an average of 20 percent in the six-month period after the last false-positive denial. This suggests that roughly 20 percent of cardholders may stop using the card after two or more false declines.What‰Ûªs more, the company said the average monthly amount spent on the card after two or more false-positive denials declined by 15 percent on average in the six months after the false denials. Fiserv noted that Mastercard Decision Intelligence is different from other scoring products because it takes a broader approach to assessing, scoring and learning from consumer transactions.","Fiserv, a provider of financial services technology, announced news on Tuesday (March 6) that it is now offering Mastercard Decision Intelligence, a fraud detection service.Fiserv‰Ûªs research shows that the number of active cards after two or more false-positive denials declines by an average of 20 percent in the six-month period after the last false-positive denial.This suggests that roughly 20 percent of cardholders may stop using the card after two or more false declines.What‰Ûªs more, the company said the average monthly amount spent on the card after two or more false-positive denials declined by 15 percent on average in the six months after the false denials.Fiserv noted that Mastercard Decision Intelligence is different from other scoring products because it takes a broader approach to assessing, scoring and learning from consumer transactions.","['offers', 'falsepositive', 'financial', 'transactions', 'denials', 'false', 'intelligence', 'decision', 'fiserv', 'declines', 'mastercard']",,,[],2018-03-07 07:10:31+00:00,https://www.pymnts.com/fraud-prevention/2018/fiserv-mastercard-decision-intelligence/,,,,
Mastercard tops estimates as consumer spend more,"By AnnaMaria AndriotisMastercard Inc. reported stronger-than-expected earnings and revenue for the second quarter as consumers boosted their spending.Mastercard CEO Ajay Banga said on the company's earnings call that Kroger, the largest traditional grocery chain in the U.S. by sales, will be converting its co-brand credit card program to the Mastercard network. That is a switch from the Visa Inc. network that the cards have been running on. Mr. Banga said the issuer remains U.S. Bank. The card program will launch by the end of 2017, with new cards to be issued by spring 2018.Profit for the second quarter increased 20% to $1.18 billion, or $1.10 a share, from $983 million, or 89 cents a share, a year earlier. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected profit of $1.1 billion and earnings per share of $1.04.Mastercard shares edged down 0.9%. The stock closed Wednesday at a record high of $130.99.Net revenue increased 13% to $3.1 billion from a year prior, also beating analysts' estimates. That was fueled by an ongoing rise in gross dollar volume transactions occurring on the Mastercard network, which increased 6% worldwide to $1.28 trillion in the second quarter from the year prior. Mastercard, like Visa, is a major network on which credit card and debit card transactions are processed.The company also benefited from an increase in cardholders using Mastercard cards outside of the country they are issued in. Those ""cross-border"" volume fees increased 14% from a year prior to $984 million. Also up are the number of transactions occurring on its network rather than on domestic networks in foreign markets. Those ""switched transactions"" increased 17% from a year prior.Mr. Banga said Mastercard is finalizing its latest application to enter the Chinese domestic market. The company is reviewing several options including filing a sole application or pursuing a ""joint venture"" with another company. ""What's really important here is to get it right out of the gate,"" he said.Visa's CEO Al Kelly said last week that the company filed an application with the People's Bank of China for a domestic license. The U.S. and Chinese governments reached an agreement in May that is supposed to result in more access to the Chinese economy for electronic-payments providers. That reignited hopes that Visa and Mastercard may get more market share in China.The companies are benefiting from a booming card market as more consumers switch to using cards or paying with phones that are linked to cards. The rise in online shopping also helps card companies.In the U.S., credit card spending and debt is on the rise, fueled in part by the ongoing rewards wars as issuers offer more in points and cash back to consumers.Operating expenses continued to rise as the company pays out more in advertising and marketing and shares in more costs with card issuers on rewards programs. They increased 7% from a year prior, but when excluding litigation costs that the company incurred a year prior, total adjusted operating expenses increased 17% on a currency-neutral basis.Write to AnnaMaria Andriotis at annamaria.andriotis@wsj.com","Mastercard CEO Ajay Banga said on the company's earnings call that Kroger, the largest traditional grocery chain in the U.S. by sales, will be converting its co-brand credit card program to the Mastercard network.The card program will launch by the end of 2017, with new cards to be issued by spring 2018.Mastercard, like Visa, is a major network on which credit card and debit card transactions are processed.The company also benefited from an increase in cardholders using Mastercard cards outside of the country they are issued in.Those ""switched transactions"" increased 17% from a year prior.","['card', 'mastercard', 'tops', 'transactions', 'rise', 'company', 'cards', 'share', 'network', 'spend', 'consumer', 'increased', 'estimates', 'prior']",,,[],7/27/17 0:00,https://www.marketwatch.com/story/mastercard-tops-estimates-as-consumer-spend-more-2017-07-27,,,,

In a brief phone interview, the former city CTO said Mastercard's work with cities could span applications ranging from public transit to financial services.During his two years running New York's civic tech, GamiÌ±o oversaw projects like the rollout of the city's Internet of Things implementations, which included internet-connected devices spanning bus stops that display real-time arrival information, as well as garbage cans that inform public works crews when they're full. He also oversaw the expansion of free Wi-Fi to public housing projects like the Queensbridge Houses, the country's largest public-housing settlement.GamiÌ±o made the announcement about his new job during the first day of the Smart Cities New York conference. Prior to working for New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, GamiÌ±o served as the chief information officer of San Francisco, and before that as the chief information and innovation officer in El Paso, Texas. He said that even with Mastercard's worldwide reach, he'll remain based in New York for now.""I got a lot of calls and texts asking if I‰Ûªm moving back,"" after leaving de Blasio's cabinet, GamiÌ±o said.Mastercard says it works with more than 100 cities around the world on transit payments, urban-planning data and electronic transactions used by businesses and governments. Several mass-transit systems around the world, including New York-area commuter rail lines and the London Underground, allow passengers to pay fares using the company's mobile and contactless payment products.""What we‰Ûªre really focused on now is engaging with cities,"" GamiÌ±o said. ""These challenges cities face are best solved through collaboration. They are not only big and challenging and require a lot of horsepower, they‰Ûªre better solved by the private sector and public sector working together.""GamiÌ±o sees his role in step with the smart city movement's embrace of public-private partnerships, with Mastercard using its global presence as a way in and out of cities' modernization efforts.""We have the ability to convene partnerships in a way some other tech industry players might not be able to,"" GamiÌ±o told StateScoop.

Investors expect higher earnings growth on Mastercard Incorporated (MA),"Mastercard Incorporated (MA) stock price traded Upswing on volume of 3.3 million shares in recent session. Shares are clocking price at $193.35 with change of 0.16%. The company‰Ûªs 3-months average volume stands at 4.07 million. When we divide the last trade volume by the 3-month average volume, we found out a relative volume of 0.81. Currently Analysts have a mean recommendation of 1.70 on the shares. Current trade price levels places MA‰Ûªs stock about ‰ÛÒ0.19% away from the 52-week high and closed 67.33% away from the 52-week low. The total dollar value of all 1.03 billion outstanding shares is 199.17 billion. The beta factor is 1.19.Volatility shows sense of how far the stock will fall if the market takes a dive and how high stock will rise if the bull starts to climb. A stock with a beta more than 1 means high volatile and less than 1 means low volatile.Price earnings ratio (P/E) ratio Analysis about Mastercard Incorporated (MA):Mastercard Incorporated (MA) stock analysis is based on price earnings ratio (P/E) ratio. P/E tells more about the company current situation and future performance. The price earnings ratio (P/E) ratio helps investors analyze how much they should pay for a stock based on its current earnings. This is why the price to earnings ratio is often called a price multiple or earnings multiple. Investors use this ratio to decide what multiple of earnings a share is worth. In other words, how many times earnings they are willing to pay. As the P/E goes up, it shows that current investor sentiment is that the company is worth more.Price earnings ratio (P/E) ratio of Mastercard Incorporated (MA) is 40.37. MA has price to earnings growth (PEG) ratio of 1.88 and Forward P/E of 26.16.Companies with higher future earnings are usually expected to issue higher dividends or have appreciating stock in the future. Obviously, fair market value of a stock is based on more than just predicted future earnings. Investor speculation and demand also help increase a share‰Ûªs price over time. The price to earnings ratio indicates the expected price of a share based on its earnings. As a company‰Ûªs earnings per share being to rise, so does their market value per share. A company with a high P/E ratio usually indicated positive future performance and investors are willing to pay more for this company‰Ûªs shares.Note: The price-to-earnings ratio is a powerful, but limited tool. For investors, it allows a very quick snapshot of the company‰Ûªs finances without getting bogged down in the details of an accounting report. Therefore, P/E ratio should be used cautiously. Investment decisions should not be based solely on the P/E ratio. It is better to use it in conjunction with other ratios and measures.Trend Direction of Mastercard Incorporated (MA)Typically 20-day simple moving average is useful at identifying swing trading trends lasting 20 days. Shorter moving average timeframes are more sensitive to price fluctuations and can pick up on trend changes more quickly than longer-term moving averages. However, these more frequent signals may also result in more ‰ÛÏwhipsaws‰Ûù, resulting in erroneous trade signals. Mastercard Incorporated (MA) recently closed with rise of 6.84% to its 20-Day Simple Moving Average. This short time frame picture represents an upward movement of current price over average price of last 20 days. Now moving toward intermediate time frame, 50-day Moving average is more useful at showing position trading trends lasting 50 days. Shares of MA moved upward with change of 8.44% to its 50-day Moving average. This rising movement shows positive prices direction over last 50 days.Finally observing long term time frame, 200-day simple moving average is more helpful at telling general investing trends lasting 200 days. Longer moving average timeframes are less sensitive to price fluctuations than shorter term timeframes and will generate far few signals. This will reduce the number of ‰ÛÏwhipsaws‰Ûù, which is good, but will also generate signals later than when using shorter term averages. MA stock price revealed optimistic move of 23.57% comparing average price of last 200 days. This comparison showed up direction of price above its 200-SMA.Common shareholders want to know how profitable their capital is in the businesses they invest it in. The company gives a ROE of 73.70%. The higher the ROE, the better the company is at generating profits. Return on Assets (ROA) ratio indicates how profitable a company is relative to its total assets. The ROA is 20.40%. A company that manages their assets well will have a high return, while if manages their assets poorly will have a low return. ROI is 44.00%. A positive result means that returns exceed costs. Analysts therefore consider the investment a net gain. The opposite kind of result, a negative means that costs outweigh returns. Analysts therefore view the investment as a net loss.","Mastercard Incorporated (MA) stock price traded Upswing on volume of 3.3 million shares in recent session.Price earnings ratio (P/E) ratio Analysis about Mastercard Incorporated (MA):Mastercard Incorporated (MA) stock analysis is based on price earnings ratio (P/E) ratio.The price earnings ratio (P/E) ratio helps investors analyze how much they should pay for a stock based on its current earnings.This is why the price to earnings ratio is often called a price multiple or earnings multiple.Price earnings ratio (P/E) ratio of Mastercard Incorporated (MA) is 40.37.","['shares', 'stock', 'investors', 'moving', 'average', 'higher', 'incorporated', 'company', 'ma', 'expect', 'growth', 'ratio', 'mastercard', 'earnings', 'price', 'pe']",,,"['Danielle Lockwood', 'Danielle Lockwood Is An Experienced Writer', 'Editor', 'Proofreader.

Mastercard Will Support Government Backed Cryptocurrencies,"Mastercard has announced that it is receptive to using nationally backed central bank issued digital currency in the future while holding on to its stance that all others are ‰ÛÏjunk‰Ûù, The Financial Times reported.Mastercard Will Deal With National Digital CurrencyIn an interview with the FT Ari Sarkar, Mastercard co-president for the Asia-Pacific region, spoke about the future of Mastercard concerning its relationship with cryptocurrency.He said that the credit giant is willing to deal with cryptocurrency that is government backed. ‰ÛÏIf governments look to create national digital currency we‰Ûªd be very happy to look at those in a more favorable way [compared with existing cryptocurrencies],‰ÛùWhile there is a long list of governments exploring a central bank backed cryptocurrency which includes England, Canada, China, Russia, India, Dubai, and Estonia, only Venezuela has actually launched one, and that to major international criticism.This is not a change in stance from October 2017 when Mastercard CEO Ajay Banga referred to cryptocurrency as ‰ÛÏjunk‰Ûù in a conversation with the Financial Times as he also said that if there were government-backed digital currency Mastercard would be involved. Saying at the time.‰ÛÏIf the government creates digital currency, we will find a way to be in the game. We will provide rails for moving currency from customer to merchant. The government mandated digital currencies are interesting. Non-government mandated currency is junk.‰ÛùSarkar also talked about a pilot program in Japan and Singapore that would allow Bitcoin traders to cash out directly onto their MasterCard. Adding that ‰ÛÏThe pilot] is a toe in the water, we‰Ûªre fully cognizant of the reputational risk.‰Ûù5% Fee With InterestEarlier last month Visa and Mastercard created a backlash of criticism when it relabeled cryptocurrency transactions from ‰ÛÏpurchases‰Ûù to ‰ÛÏcash advances‰Ûù. This meant that traders using their cards were being charged an additional five percent from the credit company on top of any fees charged by the exchange.On top of the percentage added on as cash advance traders would also be charged interest from the moment of the purchase. In some reported cases the interest would be over 20%. Still, Mastercard has not been ignoring the developing technologies completely as Sarkar mentioned Mastercard Labs, the credit company‰Ûªs research arm, has filed for more than 30 patents related to blockchain technology and cryptocurrency.Recently banks including Lloyds of London, Virgin Money in Australia, and Citigroup in the US, have banned customers from using credit cards for cryptocurrency purchases.","Mastercard has announced that it is receptive to using nationally backed central bank issued digital currency in the future while holding on to its stance that all others are ‰ÛÏjunk‰Ûù, The Financial Times reported.Mastercard Will Deal With National Digital CurrencyIn an interview with the FT Ari Sarkar, Mastercard co-president for the Asia-Pacific region, spoke about the future of Mastercard concerning its relationship with cryptocurrency.He said that the credit giant is willing to deal with cryptocurrency that is government backed.‰ÛÏIf the government creates digital currency, we will find a way to be in the game.Recently banks including Lloyds of London, Virgin Money in Australia, and Citigroup in the US, have banned customers from using credit cards for cryptocurrency purchases.","['cryptocurrency', 'using', 'cash', 'traders', 'digital', 'backed', 'currency', 'charged', 'cryptocurrencies', 'credit', 'mastercard', 'support']",,,"['Martin Young', 'Guest Author', 'Thomas Delahunty', 'John Mcmahon', 'Mr. Akpan', 'Hodl Masta']",3/20/18 0:00,https://www.newsbtc.com/2018/03/20/mastercard-will-support-government-backed-cryptocurrencies-not-junk/,,,,
Mastercard Foundation‰Ûªs Innovative Teaching centre opens in September,"Last month, Mastercard Foundation launched a landmark project targeting to create 30 million jobs in Africa. The ‰Û÷Young Africa Works‰Ûª, which was officially unveiled in Kigali will particularly see the foundation invest USD100 million in Rwanda for the next five years.Sunday Times‰Ûª Julius Bizimungu spoke to Reeta Roy, the President and Chief Executive Officer of Mastercard Foundation to share insights on how the new initiative will create the targeted jobs, and the extent to which Rwanda will benefit from the new investment.Below are excerpts;Mastercard Foundation announced last month in Kigali the new strategy, Young Africa Works, which seeks to create millions of jobs for young Africans. Take us through the process in which these jobs will be created?Our new strategy focuses on providing young people, particularly young women, with the skills, education, and financial tools and services they need to find dignified and fulfilling work.We will work with governments, the private sector, and educational organizations to improve the quality of education and vocational training so that it equips young people with the skills employers need; leverages technology to connect employers and job seekers; and enables entrepreneurs and small businesses to grow and create jobs through access to financial services.The Foundation is making more investments in a continent where it already has made its footprint for the last decade. What is driving your commitment to invest in Africa?The Mastercard Foundation is committed to working in Africa because there is a tremendous opportunity to make a significant impact.Over the last decade, the Foundation‰Ûªs programmes have improved the lives of more than 25 million people in Africa. It has been a time of listening, doing, and acquiring insight about how we can contribute to a world where all people have the opportunity to learn and prosper.We see this as an optimistic and exciting time for the continent. Young people today are growing up with better access to education, health, technology, and opportunities. However, over the next 12 years, the number of young people in the African labour market will increase to 375 million.Most importantly, it is young people who have continued to inspire and motivate us. Over and over, they have told us to be bold in our goals. We know that young people want to drive the change. They want to be more than just beneficiaries of programmes; they want to be job creators. Young people are leading the way, and we want to accompany them on their journey.To what extent do you see foundations like yours taking part in addressing pressing societal issues like poverty and youth unemployment especially in developing countries?Foundations around the world are addressing pressing societal issues.As an independent, private foundation, the Mastercard Foundation is well placed to address this challenge of youth employment in Africa.We want to leverage our learning and develop programmes that are country-specific and integrated. We believe this will achieve greater impact on the lives of young people in Africa as well as their families, communities, and countries.We also bring private sector approaches, expertise, and a long-term perspective to this challenge.Our Foundation is a funder, convener, and catalyst for innovation and change. We want to influence and inspire others to work with us, or alongside us, to address the challenge of youth employment in Africa.It is estimated that, by 2030, there will be more than 375 million people under the age of 35 in the labour market. How can Africa create meaningful jobs for these young people?The recent signing of the African Continental Free Trade Area (CFTA) is an important milestone for the continent‰Ûªs growth and prosperity. This agreement will set the stage to expand markets and create jobs.Additionally, strategies that promote education, skills training, entrepreneurial development, and financial services for young people will be critical in advancing economic and social progress.Talking about the new Foundation‰Ûªs strategy, Rwanda is the first country where implementation will take place. Why did you choose Rwanda in the first place?Rwanda has generated a momentum on which we can build. In the last two decades, the country has experienced a period of sustained economic growth, social development, and political reform, lifting a million people out of extreme poverty. We have found strong partners in the Government and the private sector.Since 2001, the Foundation has committed more than US$190 million to education, youth employment, and financial inclusion projects in Rwanda. Close to 1.75 million citizens have benefitted from our projects.Launching our two new initiatives, Hanga Ahazaza and Leaders in Teaching, in Rwanda allows the Foundation to leverage existing partnerships and networks, and to build on our knowledge and expertise.You made a commitment to double your investment in the country, adding more USD100 million in the next five years. What impact do you want to see in the next half decade?The Foundation is driven to achieve long-lasting impact. That is why we are working closely with governments, the private sector, educational institutions, and young people to find sustainable, innovative solutions that are aligned with local, regional, and national priorities.With Hanga Ahazaza and Leaders in Teaching, we aim to improve the quality of education and vocational training so that it equips young Rwandans with the skills they need to secure dignified and fulfilling employment. In addition, our Centre for Innovative Teaching and Learning in ICT will explore new and innovative approaches to improving educational outcomes.After five years, we want to see a demonstration effect. What we learn in Rwanda, we will bring and adapt in other countries. We want to influence and inspire others to work with us, or alongside us, to address the challenge of youth employment in Africa.In Rwanda, you launched two programmes that will create thousands of jobs for young people and women. Tell us how these initiatives will benefit Rwandans?Hanga Ahazaza aligns with Rwanda‰Ûªs goal to build a globally competitive tourism and hospitality industry, which is projected to create 150,000 direct jobs by 2030.Working together with TVETs and the private sector, we will prepare 30,000 young people to enter into or advance their careers in this industry. We will also enable entrepreneurs to access capital and technical support so they can grow their businesses and the sector. At least half of the young people who participate in Hanga Ahazaza will be young women.Leaders in Teaching aims to remove the barriers to quality teaching and learning so that young people have the skills and competencies they need to succeed in work and in life. Working with the Government and educators in Rwanda, we will provide training and mentoring to 8,250 teachers in STEM disciplines. We will improve the capacity of 2,250 head teachers to lead positive instructional environments in schools. In addition, we will engage 600 passionate young people in the teaching profession. Through this initiative, more than 250,000 secondary school students in Rwanda will benefit from relevant secondary education.How would you describe the impact of your work in the country, and how do you track progress of your work?Since 2011, close to 1.75 million Rwandans have benefitted from our programmes that expand and enhance financial inclusion, education, and youth livelihoods.We work with partners like One Acre Fund, to increase productivity of smallholder farms through agricultural training and increased access to finance; SNV Netherlands Development Organisation, to provide young women and men with life, business, and technical skills training and linking them to employment opportunities; and Forum for African Women Educationalists (FAWE), as part of the Mastercard Foundation Scholars Program, to enable students to complete quality secondary and university education in Rwanda and become catalysts for social and economic transformation across Africa.The Mastercard Foundation is a learning organisation. At the onset of our projects, we collaborate with partners to define what we want to achieve and learn. We share what we‰Ûªve learned within our network and beyond, so that others can magnify our impact.How soon shall we see the Regional Centre for Innovative Teaching and Learning in Rwanda up and working?The first Centre for Innovative Teaching and Learning, focused on ICT, will be established in Kigali in September 2018.What core aims will the centre be having, and was the decision to establish it here based on your successful work in the country?We established the Mastercard Foundation Centre for Innovative Teaching and Learning in ICT in Rwanda based on the country‰Ûªs significant progress in strengthening its education system over the past decade. Rwanda has improved quality, promoted entrepreneurship, and changed the core curriculum to prepare students for a competency-based world.This Centre will develop and disseminate promising practices in ICT for teaching and learning in secondary education across Africa. It will support education leaders to formulate evidence-based ICT policies and plans; foster a network of education innovators; and develop new digital learning resources for African classrooms.The Centre will also advance understanding of ‰Û÷what works‰Ûª in ICT for education through knowledge generation and sharing of best practices.editorial@newtimes.co.rw","In addition, our Centre for Innovative Teaching and Learning in ICT will explore new and innovative approaches to improving educational outcomes.How soon shall we see the Regional Centre for Innovative Teaching and Learning in Rwanda up and working?The first Centre for Innovative Teaching and Learning, focused on ICT, will be established in Kigali in September 2018.We established the Mastercard Foundation Centre for Innovative Teaching and Learning in ICT in Rwanda based on the country‰Ûªs significant progress in strengthening its education system over the past decade.This Centre will develop and disseminate promising practices in ICT for teaching and learning in secondary education across Africa.","['opens', 'million', 'rwanda', 'learning', 'teaching', 'innovative', 'create', 'africa', 'education', 'centre', 'foundations', 'jobs', 'mastercard', 'foundation', 'young']",,,['Google'],2018-04-29 00:51:40+02:00,http://www.newtimes.co.rw/news/mastercard-foundations-innovative-teaching-centre-opens-september,,,,
"Better Buy: PayPal Holdings, Inc. vs. Mastercard","People around the world are expected to make 726 billion transactions using digital payment technologies by 2020, according to a recent study from Capgemini and bank BNP Paribas. With the world becoming more digital every day -- and with 85% of global transactions still being made in cash -- this massive market should only continue to grow larger in the decades ahead.PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ:PYPL) and Mastercard (NYSE:MA) are two businesses particularly well positioned to profit from these trends. But which is the better buy today? Let's find out.Financial fortitudeLet's look at some key metrics to see how PayPal and Mastercard stack up in regard to financial strength.Metric PayPal Mastercard Revenue $12.3 billion $11.9 billion Operating income $1.7 billion $6.5 billion Net income $1.6 billion $4.6 billion Operating cash flow $3.6 billion $4.7 billion Free cash flow $3.0 billion $4.3 billion Cash and investments $7.1 billion $7.4 billion Debt N/A $5.4 billionMastercard and PayPal have similar revenue bases, but Mastercard is the far more profitable business. The credit card titan's operating and net margins check in at 54% and 39%, respectively, compared twith14% and 13% for PayPal. Still, while both Mastercard and PayPal have more $7 billion in cash and investments on their balance sheets, Mastercard has over $5 billion in debt while PayPal has none. So I'll give PayPal a slight edge in terms of financial strength.Advantage: PayPal.GrowthPayPal's revenue and operating profit growth has exceeded that of Mastercard in recent years.Wall Street expects this trend to continue; PayPal is projected to grow its revenue by more than 18% in 2018, while Mastercard's sales growth is anticipated to come in at less than 13%. Moreover, analysts' forecasts have PayPal increasing its earnings per share at about 20% annually over the next five years, fueled by the growth of mobile commerce. Mastercard, meanwhile, is expected to grow its EPS by less than 18% annually during that same time.With its recent past -- and, more importantly, expected future -- growth exceeding that of its larger rival, PayPal has the edge here.Advantage: PayPal.ValuationNo better-buy discussion should take place without a look at valuation. Let's check out some key value metrics for PayPal and Mastercard, including price-to-earnings (P/E) and price-to-earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratios.Metric PayPal Mastercard Trailing P/E 61.48 37.11 Forward P/E 34.82 29.45 PEG 2.06 1.91On all three metrics, Mastercard's shares are less expensive than PayPal's. Though on a PEG basis, these two payment titans' valuations are closer than I expected.Advantage: Mastercard.The better buy is...PayPal and Mastercard are both excellent ways to profit from the boom in digital payments. But with its superior financial strength and greater growth prospects, PayPal is the better buy today.","PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ:PYPL) and Mastercard (NYSE:MA) are two businesses particularly well positioned to profit from these trends.Metric PayPal Mastercard Revenue $12.3 billion $11.9 billion Operating income $1.7 billion $6.5 billion Net income $1.6 billion $4.6 billion Operating cash flow $3.6 billion $4.7 billion Free cash flow $3.0 billion $4.3 billion Cash and investments $7.1 billion $7.4 billion Debt N/A $5.4 billionMastercard and PayPal have similar revenue bases, but Mastercard is the far more profitable business.Still, while both Mastercard and PayPal have more $7 billion in cash and investments on their balance sheets, Mastercard has over $5 billion in debt while PayPal has none.Metric PayPal Mastercard Trailing P/E 61.48 37.11 Forward P/E 34.82 29.45 PEG 2.06 1.91On all three metrics, Mastercard's shares are less expensive than PayPal's.But with its superior financial strength and greater growth prospects, PayPal is the better buy today.","['cash', 'paypal', 'holdings', 'buy', 'billion', 'revenue', 'recent', 'better', 'profit', 'growth', 'peg', 'vs', 'operating', 'mastercard']",,,"['Joe Tenebruso', 'Joe Honed His Investing Skills As An Analyst For Stock Advisor', 'Fool One', 'Supernova', 'Million Dollar Portfolio', 'Income Investor.

Some of the products we feature are from our partners. Here‰Ûªs how we make moneyPayPal had 210 million active accounts as of August 2017, and like most large businesses, it wants to keep its customers coming back. That‰Ûªs why it lets users earn rewards with credit cards like the PayPal Extras Mastercardå¨, issued by Synchrony Bank.But even PayPal diehards might earn more cash back or better travel rewards with other credit cards ‰ÛÓ including another option offered by PayPal.The basicsWith the PayPal Extras Mastercardå¨, you earn 3 points per dollar spent at gas stations and restaurants, 2 points per dollar for purchases made on PayPal or eBay, and 1 point per dollar for all other spending. Cardholders can earn up to 50,000 points per year.You must earn $50 to make a cash redemption, which is deposited into your PayPal account. But you need 6,000 points to earn $50, which works out to a reward rate of 0.83 cents per point. The standard cash-back return for most cards is 1 cent per point. You can also redeem points for travel, merchandise or gift certificates, although there are minimum redemption thresholds for those categories, as well.The $0. The ongoing APR is 20.99% - 24.99% Variable. You may add an authorized user to your card.Other redemption options and benefitsYou‰Ûªll have to plan far ahead to use points for travel. You must book flights through the PayPal Extras Mastercardå¨ portal at least 21 days in advance and you might have to spend Saturday night at your destination to use points. Stopovers can‰Ûªt exceed four hours, and you must complete travel within 30 days of the original departure date. Also, you can redeem only for coach seats.Hotel stay and car rental redemptions have similar restrictions: 21-day advance booking is required and blackout dates apply. You need a minimum of 15,000 points to redeem all travel rewards.Merchandise redemptions require at least 3,000 points, and gift cards for restaurants, gas stations and retail stores require 2,200 points. The PayPal shopping portal offers discounts at many online stores and travel sites such as CheapOair.com.Unlike many credit card reward programs, reward points earned with the PayPal Extras Mastercardå¨ expire. You must use them within 24 months of earning them or you lose them.Because the card is a Mastercard, you get all company‰Ûªs typical purchase and protection benefits. These include zero liability for unauthorized transactions, ID theft alerts and ID theft resolution help, extended manufacturer warranties, and price protection within 60 days of a purchase.Alternative cardsHigh minimum redemption levels are the PayPal Extras Mastercardå¨‰Ûªs greatest drawback. If you‰Ûªre a PayPal member and are seeking cash back, you might consider the PayPal Cashback Mastercardå¨, which was introduced in August 2017. It pays a flat 2% cash-back rate on all purchases, doesn‰Ûªt limit the amount you can earn and doesn‰Ûªt require a minimum redemption amount. You can redeem cash directly to your PayPal account, and it doesn‰Ûªt charge an annual fee.If you want a higher rewards rate, the Blue Cash Preferredå¨ Card from American Express offers 6% cash back at U.S. supermarkets on up to $6,000 in spending per year, 3% cash back at U.S. gas stations and select U.S. department stores, and 1% back on other purchases. This card also comes with a $95 And it offers a welcome bonus: $200 statement credit after you spend $1,000 in purchases on your new Card within the first 3 months. Terms Apply.And if you‰Ûªre looking for more flexible travel rewards, consider the Capital Oneå¨ Ventureå¨ Rewards Credit Card. You get a bonus after signing up: Enjoy a one-time bonus of 50,000 miles once you spend $3,000 on purchases within 3 months from account opening, equal to $500 in travel ‰ÛÓ and pile up an unlimited 2 miles for every dollar spent on anything. You can travel on any airline or stay at any hotel anytime without restrictions. Redemption is simple: You apply your miles to any travel-related expense and it‰Ûªs taken off your statement. The annual fee is $0 for the first year, then $95, and there are no foreign transaction fees.Should you get PayPal Extras Mastercardå¨?If you use PayPal a lot, having the PayPal Extras Mastercardå¨ and linking it to your account might make your bookkeeping a bit easier. But even if you‰Ûªre a diehard PayPal user or eBay shopper, the PayPal Extras Mastercardå¨‰Ûªs rewards aren‰Ûªt easy to earn and redeem. You‰Ûªre better off with one of NerdWallet‰Ûªs best rewards cards.","That‰Ûªs why it lets users earn rewards with credit cards like the PayPal Extras Mastercardå¨, issued by Synchrony Bank.Unlike many credit card reward programs, reward points earned with the PayPal Extras Mastercardå¨ expire.Should you get PayPal Extras Mastercardå¨?If you use PayPal a lot, having the PayPal Extras Mastercardå¨ and linking it to your account might make your bookkeeping a bit easier.But even if you‰Ûªre a diehard PayPal user or eBay shopper, the PayPal Extras Mastercardå¨‰Ûªs rewards aren‰Ûªt easy to earn and redeem.","['cash', 'card', 'think', 'earn', 'users', 'redemption', 'paypal', 'travel', 'points', 'rewards', 'mastercard', 'twice', 'extras']",,,"['Ellen Cannon', 'About The Author', 'Read More']",2017-09-05 11:54:03-07:00,https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/credit-cards/paypal-extras-mastercard-review/,,,,

Mastercard says India will become a less-cash economy‰ÛÓbut only in 10 years,"As ATMs run dry in India, the Narendra Modi government and the payments industry have learnt an important lesson: cash isn‰Ûªt going anywhere.While the government shifted the goalpost several times following November 2016‰Ûªs shock demonetisation, one of its key objectives was to increase digital transactions. And though spending via cards and mobile money did increase, the levels are nowhere close to the initial estimates.But despite the bumpy ride, digital payment firms are not perturbed. Sarah Quinlan, Mastercard‰Ûªs head of market insights, believes cash transactions will reduce, but only in a decade or more, by when consumer behaviour will change. After all, India has a significantly high penetration of mobile phones and is also home to a fairly young population. This section of consumers is more comfortable with technology and is most likely to adopt digital payments with ease.Also, the cost of printing and handling cash is high, therefore the benefits and convenience of transacting via card or digital will soon nudge people into shifting to e-payments.Quartz spoke to Quinlan about Mastercard‰Ûªs fight against cash, the evolving customer, and the firm‰Ûªs plans for India. Edited excerpts:Cash is returning to the Indian economy and ATMs are running dry. What went wrong?I think what happened here is that the economy accelerated and the government wasn‰Ûªt prepared. Digital transactions have picked up, it has fallen from the highs that we saw immediately after demonetisation but it is still increasing. There is no doubt that there is still a huge cultural version of cash here and so there is miles to go. It will take another 5-10 years for India to become a less-cash economy. If the government continues to have a strong will, it can be faster. However, we still have a lot of work to do and a long way to go in India.What do you think can be the game changer in India‰Ûªs digital payments journey?The key thing in India is that almost everyone has a mobile phone, so that will end up playing a crucial role in payments. The huge young population that can adapt easily and has used technology from day one will play a critical role. As more of these people enter the workforce, we can expect digital transactions to increase. The way to get people to use it is by keeping it simple, less friction, and show them the real benefits of using it.Why have some form of digital payments such as QR-based and the near field communication technology not taken off in India?The challenge is getting everyone together at the same time in these payment methods. So consumers, merchants, card issuers, and the government, all need to be on the same page for these transactions. And it isn‰Ûªt an easy task.You‰Ûªre also working with the government to accelerate digital payments. Can you give us some details about it?We are looking at how to digitise certain payments to reduce the cash burden. The most important area would be transit because there is a lot of cash that is used in that segment. Apart from transit, the other key area is restaurants because we can see that Indian consumers are dining out more.As e-transactions pick up, so do cases of online fraud. What is Mastercard doing to prevent it?We are looking at tokenisation to reduce frauds and are planning to bring it by this year end to India. So for instance, when you are making a transaction, this service will take your 16-digit number (on the card) and will automatically create a random number, very different from your card details, and that‰Ûªs a token. In this ecosystem, it is very difficult for a fraudster to replicate your card details. So a merchant only knows what you are buying and your address but they don‰Ûªt know your bank or card details.How has the Indian consumers‰Ûª spending habits changed?Indians are spending more on discretionary items. We see a substantial rise in spending on restaurants, clothing, and jewellery apart from usual items such as grocery and fuel. This acceleration in spending reflects an overhaul in the economy that we have been seeing in the last six months.Some of the recent reports suggest that Indian consumers are still not optimistic, so what explains this increase in spending?The interesting thing is that what people say and what they do can sometimes be very different. And as I am looking at the data, I can say that if people truly felt nervous, they wouldn‰Ûªt be spending at all but that is not the case. There are still challenges that the Indian economy needs to deal with‰Û_but people have begun spending.","While the government shifted the goalpost several times following November 2016‰Ûªs shock demonetisation, one of its key objectives was to increase digital transactions.Sarah Quinlan, Mastercard‰Ûªs head of market insights, believes cash transactions will reduce, but only in a decade or more, by when consumer behaviour will change.Digital transactions have picked up, it has fallen from the highs that we saw immediately after demonetisation but it is still increasing.Why have some form of digital payments such as QR-based and the near field communication technology not taken off in India?Apart from transit, the other key area is restaurants because we can see that Indian consumers are dining out more.","['cash', 'card', 'india', 'digital', 'payments', 'lesscash', 'spending', 'economybut', 'transactions', 'indian', 'consumers', 'mastercard', 'economy']",,,['Nupur Anand'],,https://qz.com/1262849/mastercard-says-india-will-become-a-less-cash-economy-but-only-in-10-years/,,,,
How Mastercard Is Powering Solar Payments in Africa,"BARCELONA‰ÛÓMastercard continues to expand its digital payments capabilities far beyond the credit card. At Mobile World Congress, the company announced that its Masterpass Quick Response (QR) technology will underpin pay-as-you-go plans for solar panels in East Africa.The credit card processing and payments giant is partnering with Kenyan solar energy company M-KOPA, which supplies power to 3 million people. Masterpass QR is currently available in Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Uganda and supported by a network of mobile network operators and banks, but this marks the first extension of the payments tech into solar.The Masterpass QR-powered payments will allow M-KOPA customers purchasung a solar home system on credit to make small daily payments by either scanning a QR code from their smartphone, or entering the merchant ID associated with the QR code into their feature phone. Matt Miller, vice president of new product development for Mastercard's Commerce Device Team, said these flexible mobile payment methods are designed to make it easy for the 625 million people in Sub-Saharan Africa lacking access to electricity to pay for cheap solar energy, rather than relying on options such as charcoal and kerosene.""We're making sure that solar payments are easy and seamless and can be explored in many different markets, especially those who are off the grid without access to traditional electricity,"" Miller said. ""They can procure the panel and pay for it over time without a banking relationship. The Masterpass QR framework allows customers across the globe to participate, and with a technical interface that can be used with everything from a smartphone to a feature phone.""Mastercard and M-KOPA are piloting the program in Uganda, with plans to extend across East Africa. Miller said Mastercard also sees opportunities beyond that to partner with mobile network operators and extend Masterpass QR payments to other utilities like water and gas.""Solar is a great place to start, and we see it as a big opportunity globally when looking at other markets where solar can be of value,"" Miller said.That broader strategy ties into Mastercard's other MWC announcement: the expansion of its Engage digital commerce and Internet of Things (IoT) platform. Mastercard said that Engage now has more than 150 participating vendors in its network enabling capabilities such as Masterpass-enabled digital wallets, tokenization, instant payouts, and mobile point-of-sale (POS) solutions.Mastercard said Engage is now enabling a full payments ecosystem for issuers, merchants, and IoT device manufacturers. The platform will now have a directory that provides merchants with access to 100 vendors who are self-certified for mobile POS solutions, and the company plans partner with vendors to integrate Mastercard Send and MoneySend for instant payments. IoT manufacturers can also use Engage to enable secure payments through Mastercard's Digital Enablement Service. One vendor, Fit Pay, projects it will payments-enable more than 9 million wearables in 2018.""How can we make sure our products can be adapted to the most advanced technologies? By making sure there's always a safe, secure, and easy way to pay,"" Miller said.","BARCELONA‰ÛÓMastercard continues to expand its digital payments capabilities far beyond the credit card.The credit card processing and payments giant is partnering with Kenyan solar energy company M-KOPA, which supplies power to 3 million people.Miller said Mastercard also sees opportunities beyond that to partner with mobile network operators and extend Masterpass QR payments to other utilities like water and gas.That broader strategy ties into Mastercard's other MWC announcement: the expansion of its Engage digital commerce and Internet of Things (IoT) platform.By making sure there's always a safe, secure, and easy way to pay,"" Miller said.","['masterpass', 'digital', 'pay', 'solar', 'payments', 'engage', 'africa', 'mobile', 'qr', 'network', 'miller', 'powering', 'mastercard']",,,"['About The Author', ""Rob Marvin Is Pcmag'S Associate Features Editor.

MasterCard Files Patent for Faster Blockchain Node Verification,"Furthering its interest in blockchain-based technology, MasterCard has filed a patent for a system designated to increase the speed with which blockchain nodes are being verified.It seems the bees in the company‰Ûªs crypto department have been busier than one may think. Earlier in April, MasterCard Labs, the company‰Ûªs innovation section, said that they‰Ûªre looking to hire 175 more staff members, including blockchain experts.The company has now filed another blockchain-related patent, dated April 26th, for a system that would supposedly take care of a rather pressing issue.The Problem at HandIn the aforementioned patent application, MasterCard clearly outlines some of the benefits of using blockchain-based technology, saying that:One of the benefits of the blockchain is it can serve as an immutable ledger that stores a record for every transaction ever conducted via that blockchain. As such, a blockchain may store thousands, millions, or even billions of transaction records over time in a vast number of different blocks.Indeed, decentralized and verifiable record tracking and data storage are amongst the landmarks of the innovative technology, even though it has quite a lot more to offer. Nevertheless, MasterCard also goes on to explain that difficulties for newer nodes wanting to participate in the blockchain may come to light as each of the previously existing blocks (that could be billions), has to be verified by the new node before the generation of new blocks.The verification of such a large number of blocks may take a significant amount of time, during which new blocks may be added to the blockchain, further delaying the ability for the new node to participate.Offering a SolutionThe subject of the patent application is a solution for this exact problem. MasterCard wants to patent a system for the generation of a blockchain which is specifically configured for faster navigation.Shedding light on the matter, the company goes on to explain the following:The use of specialized flags and hash values included in the headers of blocks in a blockchain may enable for the speed of navigation of a blockchain to be significantly increased, which may greatly reduce the computing time and power required to verify the blockchain. As a result, navigation and verification of the blockchain may be more efficient, which may increase the ability for new nodes to participate in the blockchain, and for users and nodes to review the blockchain to identify specific transaction records.Needless to say, the patent application does attest to the company‰Ûªs interest in the innovative technology.As a matter of fact, MasterCard‰Ûªs executive was pretty clear that the company would gladly look at cryptocurrencies in a ‰Û÷favorable way,‰Ûª as long as the latter is backed by a regulator and its value is not anonymous, essentially denying all interest in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies of the kind.Do you think MasterCard will loosen its grip on cryptocurrencies? Please let us know in the comments below!Images courtesy of Shutterstock, Pixabay, and","Furthering its interest in blockchain-based technology, MasterCard has filed a patent for a system designated to increase the speed with which blockchain nodes are being verified.Earlier in April, MasterCard Labs, the company‰Ûªs innovation section, said that they‰Ûªre looking to hire 175 more staff members, including blockchain experts.As such, a blockchain may store thousands, millions, or even billions of transaction records over time in a vast number of different blocks.MasterCard wants to patent a system for the generation of a blockchain which is specifically configured for faster navigation.Needless to say, the patent application does attest to the company‰Ûªs interest in the innovative technology.","['files', 'interest', 'node', 'transaction', 'blockchain', 'patent', 'technology', 'system', 'nodes', 'verification', 'blocks', 'cryptocurrencies', 'faster', 'mastercard']",,,['Georgi Georgiev'],2018-05-01 23:00:06-04:00,http://bitcoinist.com/mastercard-seriously-into-blockchain-files-patent-for-quicker-node-verification/,,,,

The Clearing House gets Mastercard approval for tokenization,"The Clearing House has become one of the first Mastercard-certified, third-party token service providers on behalf of issuing banks.A partnership with Mastercard will allow The Clearing House, a provider of core payments infrastructure and a catalyst in the real-time payments movement in the U.S., to support current and future token capabilities.Tokenization, the process of converting a 16-digit payment card number into an alternate number or ""token"" for security purposes, will have a significant role in mobile payments, remote purchases and Internet of Things transactions.Bloomberg NewsThe Clearing House‰Ûªs tokenization solution conforms with the card industry‰Ûªs EMVCo framework and fully complies with the Mastercard Token Service Provider Standards, which were initially published in August 2016.

Mastercard opens access to its blockchain tech,"Image: MastercardMastercard has opened its blockchain technology up to developers, allowing financial institutions and merchants on a selective basis to start testing their own blockchain-based solutions.The payments giant said it both tested and validated its blockchain, and has prepared it initially for the business-to-business (B2B) space to address challenges of speed, transparency, and costs in cross-border payments.""By combining Mastercard blockchain technology with our settlement network and associated network rules, we have created a solution that is safe, secure, auditable, and easy to scale,"" Mastercard Labs executive vice president Ken Moore said.""When it comes to payments, we want to provide choice and flexibility to our partners where they are able to seamlessly use both our existing and new payment rails based on the needs and requirements of their customers.""In a video prepared by Mastercard, Ricardo Sota, manager at Payments Innovation Mastercard Labs, said the company decided to create its own technology in order to prove if blockchain will in fact transform how organisations transfer and share value among each other.The Mastercard blockchain is a permissioned blockchain, which will allow participants to maintain the distributed ledger without sacrificing scalability or performance, Sota explains in the video. He said it is based on an opaque ledger, which means the details of the transaction can only be seen by those who are participating on that transaction.""Our blockchain technology can be used for clearing in near real-time card payment transactions eliminating consolidation and improving settlement,"" he said.According to Mastercard, its technology boasts four key differentiators to others in the space, spanning privacy, flexibility, scalability, and the reach of the company's settlement network.Mastercard said its blockchain provides privacy by ensuring that transaction details are shared only amongst the participants of a transaction while maintaining a fully auditable and valid ledger of transactions, but still allowing partners to use the blockchain APIs alongside other Mastercard APIsAs the Mastercard blockchain is designed for commercial processing speed, the company said it can scale further than many others, and with the blockchain integrated into the company's 22,000 financial institution-strong payment network, users can move transactions quite far via the Mastercard network.Beyond card transactions, the application programming interfaces (APIs) can be used for payments, supply chain, and trade finance operations. Sota expects developers to also toy with non-payment transactions like proof of purchase or authenticity.""It should be fairly simple as they do not have the extra cost of hosting their own ... so they can focus on the use cases and once it's a proven solution they can scale it out,"" Sota added.With the Mastercard blockchain, the company is hoping to make the commerce ecosystem easier, faster, and safer, and the technology is expected to complement the company's existing offerings including virtual cards, Mastercard Send, and Vocalink to support all types of cross-border, account-based, blockchain-based, or card-based B2B payments.In addition to building a new solution, Mastercard said it also filed for over 35 patents in blockchain and invested in Digital Currency Group, a collective that builds, incubates, and seeds bitcoin and blockchain technology-related companies.Mastercard also recently joined the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance to explore the possibilities of the ethereum blockchain across a range of potential use cases, many that sit outside the scope of Mastercard's traditional payments environment.While the bitcoin blockchain is used to track ownership of digital currency, the ethereum blockchain -- a custom-built blockchain -- focuses on running the programming code of any decentralised application. Instead of mining for bitcoin, miners work to earn ether, a type of crypto token that fuels the network.The EEA initiative is similar to one facilitated by the Linux Foundation that aims to develop an enterprise-grade, open-source distributed ledger framework and to help identify and address important features and requirements that are missing when it comes to having a cross-industry open standard for distributed ledgers.PREVIOUS AND RELATED COVERAGEBanking giants join UBS-backed IBM blockchain trade platformIBM Blockchain-based Batavia is expected to support international trade finance transactions.Australian House of Representatives committee ponders taxation on the blockchain Headline HereWith the emergence of blockchain potentially requiring the government to find other means of tracing the income and assets of organisations and individuals, a House of Representatives committee has toyed with the idea of the ATO heading down the distributed ledger path.Origin Energy trials blockchain energy sharing initiative with Power LedgerThe trial is expected to explore the 'benefits and challenges' of customers buying and selling energy to and from their neighbours using blockchain-based technology.","Image: MastercardMastercard has opened its blockchain technology up to developers, allowing financial institutions and merchants on a selective basis to start testing their own blockchain-based solutions.""By combining Mastercard blockchain technology with our settlement network and associated network rules, we have created a solution that is safe, secure, auditable, and easy to scale,"" Mastercard Labs executive vice president Ken Moore said.The Mastercard blockchain is a permissioned blockchain, which will allow participants to maintain the distributed ledger without sacrificing scalability or performance, Sota explains in the video.""Our blockchain technology can be used for clearing in near real-time card payment transactions eliminating consolidation and improving settlement,"" he said.While the bitcoin blockchain is used to track ownership of digital currency, the ethereum blockchain -- a custom-built blockchain -- focuses on running the programming code of any decentralised application.","['opens', 'blockchain', 'technology', 'transactions', 'payments', 'blockchainbased', 'ledger', 'distributed', 'access', 'sota', 'mastercard', 'tech', 'used']",,,['Asha Mclean'],,https://www.zdnet.com/article/mastercard-opens-access-to-its-blockchain-tech/,,,,

"Blue Star Sports Rebrands to Stack Sports, Partners with Mastercard","On Monday, Blue Star Sports, a technology company formed two years ago to help support youth sport, rebranded to Stack Sports. The company also announced a major partnership with the financial services company Mastercard.When Stack Sports was founded in 2016‰ÛÓwith an infusion of capital from, Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, payment services company World Pay, and others‰ÛÓthe goal was to address a youth sports market that had grown largely fragmented and wholly untapped. The organization has since acquired more than 25 companies that serve all facets of that youth sports marketplace. More importantly, CEO Alex Alt said, Stack Sports has pulled all 25 under the same umbrella.‰ÛÏIt‰Ûªs important to understand the concept behind the vision, which was to transform the youth sports ecosystem‰ÛÓa highly fragmented landscape at the youth and grassroots level,‰Ûù Alt said. ‰ÛÏThe belief was always that these companies can work together in a way that can present an unmatched business proposition.‰ÛùAlt was brought aboard eight months ago to help spearhead the consolidation of those companies into one cohesive unit, while focusing on four key pillars of the youth sports market: organizational solutions, which help with league and team management and registration; athlete and team solutions, including recruiting platforms, highlight tools and video analysis; competition management, which includes sports event, camp and tournament planning and travel; and brand management, as youth sports is a fertile market for third-party partners like Nike, New Balance, and others.The objective, Alt said, is a simple one. Stack Sports aims to take the hassle away from everything that bogs down the youth sports experience, everything from registration and dues collecting to equipment purchasing and travel plans. The takeaway is more time on the field, less time filling out forms. Reducing the paperwork burden can have a major impact on the end consumers: the coaches, the parents, and the athletes themselves.‰ÛÏSome products in isolation can be successful, but when we can complement those same successful products with other services is where we start to transform the space,‰Ûù Alt said. ‰ÛÏOur vision is to have a ‰ÛÏstack‰Ûù of products and services that work synergistically to enhance the experience for all involved.‰ÛùBlue Star Sports‰Ûª rebranding process, which involved renowned marketing agency Siegel+Gale, started with more than 100 potential company names. The company eventually landed on Stack Sports, borrowing its name from one of the 25 properties it had acquired: Stack Media, a youth sports media company with a powerful mission of empowering athletes to reach their goals on and off the field of play.‰ÛÏYou can always put these decisions off, because they require a lot of work,‰Ûù Alt said. ‰ÛÏBut the timing was right given our efforts to bring all of our companies together and have one unified platform for growth. Stack, even though it was right under our nose, it just kept coming back around to us given its relevance to sports and technology and its authentic mission which we all rally around. Sometimes what you are looking for is right in front of you.‰ÛùWhen the company was conceived by founder and former CEO Rob Weschler, who became the chairman of the board once Alt was brought in, Blue Star had a trickle-down approach, targeting strategic alliances with national governing bodies, including US Soccer, AAU and USA Football, before reaching out to state governing bodies, and eventually, leagues, teams, coaches and players themselves. Stack is hoping to continue that theme, providing obvious answers to all the problems that vex the youth sports market, from the top on down.‰ÛÏIt‰Ûªs about the ease of use,‰Ûù Alt said. ‰ÛÏAs you work your way down the ecosystem, the reality is it‰Ûªs moms, dads and volunteers who run and coach these teams. The software has to work, and has to be easy and intuitive. Over time it just hasn‰Ûªt been so. We think there‰Ûªs an absolute opportunity to continue to push highly to the end users. We‰Ûªve got volunteers across clubs and leagues, tens of thousands of them, using our products today. At the end of the day, the more time the volunteer, the coach, can spend on the field with the kids is the difference we‰Ûªre trying to make.‰ÛùAlongside news of its rebranding, on Monday Stack Sports also announced a partnership with Mastercard that could have wide-ranging implications. In addition to payment processing and financial management tools, this could lead to debit and credit cards being directed to the youth market, potentially easing the burden of handling what can be thousands of dollars each month in an athlete‰Ûªs team and travel costs.‰ÛÏOne of the biggest challenges in youth sports is involved in the movement of payments,‰Ûù Alt said. ‰ÛÏIt‰Ûªs still relatively unsophisticated, and you‰Ûªve got registration, tournament dues, uniform purchases. And, questions like ‰Û÷Who pays for the team party?‰Ûª It was time to partner with somebody who had similar views of not only how to make a better experience, but for someone committed to the sports world. They shared our vision that there is a better way to do it, and there just aren‰Ûªt great solutions out there.‰ÛùSherri Haymond, EVP of digital partnerships at Mastercard, stressed the importance of building this type of strategic partnership in a statement. ‰ÛÏWith its ability to reach a passionate consumer base at scale,‰Ûù she said, ‰ÛÏStack Sports is an ideal collaborator as we look to provide our technology, products and platforms in new and differentiated ways.To Alt, the partnership with MasterCard signifies the continued evolution of the company he joined just eight months ago. ‰ÛÏFirst, it‰Ûªs an honor for us to be working with such an established brand like Mastercard,‰Ûù he said. ‰ÛÏIf you know anything about Mastercard, you know they‰Ûªve got a huge position in sports. They‰Ûªve been active in the sports ecosystem for a long time. It‰Ûªs a mission-driven organization, which we loved. When we think about Stack and our growing prominence of our brand, it‰Ûªs a great signal that we‰Ûªre active and willing and able to partner with brands like Mastercard to solve really big problems for our customers.‰ÛùTo learn more about Stack Sports visit the company‰Ûªs Facebook and Twitter pages","On Monday, Blue Star Sports, a technology company formed two years ago to help support youth sport, rebranded to Stack Sports.The company also announced a major partnership with the financial services company Mastercard.More importantly, CEO Alex Alt said, Stack Sports has pulled all 25 under the same umbrella.‰ÛÏYou can always put these decisions off, because they require a lot of work,‰Ûù Alt said.To Alt, the partnership with MasterCard signifies the continued evolution of the company he joined just eight months ago.","['products', 'market', 'star', 'services', 'alt', 'partners', 'youth', 'stack', 'company', 'work', 'rebrands', 'team', 'mastercard', 'blue']",,,['View All Posts Guest'],2018-05-20 22:44:55-04:00,https://www.sporttechie.com/blue-star-sports-rebrands-to-stack-sports-scores-major-partnership-with-mastercard/,,,,
"Morning Movers: Apple Rises, Snap Sinks, Mastercard Gains","The Dow Jones Industrial Average is off slightly this morning as investors wait for the Federal Reserve's decision on monetary policy this afternoon.S&P 500 futures have dipped 0.1% at 8:57 a.m. today, while Dow Jones Industrial Average futures have declined 49 points, or 0.2%. Nasdaq Composite futures have ticked up 0.1%.Yes, Apple (AAPL) is the biggie in a day full of earnings, but it's the Fed that will have everyone's attention. It's not that anyone really expects the Fed to do anything--as Barron's Matthew C. Klein explains, the Fed prefers to raise rates at meetings with press conferences--but that doesn't mean investors won't be watching for hints of what's to come. ""We are seeing a cautious start as investors await the end of the Federal Reserve meeting, which is seen as a key indicator for monetary policy,"" writes Tigress Financial Partners' Jean Ergas.And perhaps deservedly so. The Fed's preferred inflation metric--core PCE--hit 1.9% in March. That's three quarters earlier than the Fed's projection, writes Morgan Stanley economist Ellen Zentner. She doesn't expect the Fed to react yet, and in fact expects it to have ""tolerance"" for above-target inflation. ""...having persistently undershot the Fed's 2% goal, policymakers should resist the urge to push back against this nascent return to goal lest you stamp out strengthening in the underlying trend,"" she explains.And no one wants that to happen.Morning MoversEarnings & News‰Û¢ It's a good day for...oil and gas drillers.Illustration: PixabayChesapeake Energy (CHK) is up 4% to $3.10 after reporting first-quarter earnings.

Checking Out the Fundamental Data for Mastercard Incorporated (MA) ‰ÛÒ Stock News Gazette,"Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) has recently been identified as an interesting stock but more in-depth monitoring is needed for a trade decision. Now trading with a market value of 196.95B, the company has a mix of catalysts and obstacles that spring from the nature of its operations. In light of the many issues surrounding this company, we thought it was a good time to take a close look at the numbers in order to form a realistic perspective on the fundamental picture for this stock.It‰Ûªs generally a good idea to start with the most fundamental piece of the picture: the balance sheet. The balance sheet health of any company plays a key role in its ability to meet its obligations and maintain the faith of its investment base. For MA, the company currently has 7.44 billion of cash on the books. The trend over time is important to note. In this case, the company‰Ûªs debt has been growing. The company also has 22.94 billion in total assets, balanced by 17.14 billion in total liabilities, which should give you a sense of the viability of the company under any number of imagined business contexts.Mastercard Incorporated (MA) saw 1.09 billion in free cash flow last quarter, representing a quarterly net change in cash of 973 million. Perhaps most importantly where cash movements are concerned, the company saw about 1.18 billion in net operating cash flow.As far as key trends that demonstrate something of the future investment potential of this stock, we need to take a closer look at the top line, first and foremost. Last quarter, the company saw 3.58 billion in total revenues. That represents a quarterly year/year change in revenues of 0.31 in sequential terms, the MA saw sales decline by 0.08.But what about the bottom line? After all, that‰Ûªs what really matters in the end. Mastercard Incorporated (MA) is intriguing when broken down to its core data. For shareholders, given the total diluted outstanding shares of 1.06 billion, this means overall earnings per share of 1.41.

Mastercard moving to mass biometrics with new remote fingerprint scanning,"ShareMastercard wants to help everyone move beyond traditional passwords with the introduction of a new sleeve for its biometric fingerprint scanning bank cards that allows for remote authentication of a user‰Ûªs identity. The new battery-powered sleeve will mean that anyone can sign up to the biometric authentication scheme from their own home, without needing to go to a bank branch to verify their identity.Often the weakest link in any security chain are the people involved. Whether we forget our passwords or use ones that are far too simple, it‰Ûªs often easy for nefarious individuals to steal identities and the money associated with them. Using a password manager is great, but biometric authentication is something that Mastercard believes can be even more impactful, moving customers from a system of ‰ÛÏwhat they know,‰Ûù to ‰ÛÏwhat they are.‰ÛùThe biometric Mastercard cards were first trialed in early 2017 in select territories and reportedly worked rather well. They incorporated a fingerprint scanner in the card itself, which received remote power from the terminal when plugged in for payment. With no data connection, the cards compare the fingerprint with a digital imprint stored on the card itself, making remote attacks impossible.What Mastercard now hopes to do with a wider roll out though, is make it easier for card owners to get on board with the new system. Instead of having to visit their local banking branch to register their thumbprint, Mastercard‰Ûªs new ‰ÛÏsleeve,‰Ûù means they can do it from the comfort of their own home. The sleeve itself is battery powered and allows the card to scan the user‰Ûªs fingerprint, before storing it on an encrypted digital template for later authentication.Mastercard sees this as a cost-effective way of encouraging adoption of the new biometric verification feature, without having to add new equipment to banking branches around the world, nor give staff new training to help facilitate registration. Instead, the card owners themselves can complete the pre-authentication sign up process.‰ÛÏMaking life safer and simpler for consumers is the cornerstone of our efforts around biometrics and comes through the use of some incredibly sophisticated technology,‰Ûù said Bob Reany, executive vice president of identity solutions at Mastercard. ‰ÛÏPeople love the security our biometric card delivers because we put their needs first.‰Ûù","ShareMastercard wants to help everyone move beyond traditional passwords with the introduction of a new sleeve for its biometric fingerprint scanning bank cards that allows for remote authentication of a user‰Ûªs identity.They incorporated a fingerprint scanner in the card itself, which received remote power from the terminal when plugged in for payment.With no data connection, the cards compare the fingerprint with a digital imprint stored on the card itself, making remote attacks impossible.The sleeve itself is battery powered and allows the card to scan the user‰Ûªs fingerprint, before storing it on an encrypted digital template for later authentication.‰ÛÏPeople love the security our biometric card delivers because we put their needs first.‰Ûù","['card', 'sleeve', 'biometric', 'moving', 'users', 'authentication', 'scanning', 'remote', 'system', 'mass', 'cards', 'biometrics', 'fingerprint', 'mastercard']",,,[],2018-05-01 09:00:42-07:00,https://www.digitaltrends.com/cool-tech/mastercard-fingerprint-sleeve-scan/,,,,

Better Buy: Mastercard vs. PayPal Holdings,"The adoption of electronic forms of payment, especially in mobile payments, is one of the biggest megatrends in the global economy. PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ:PYPL) and Mastercard (NYSE:MA) are at the center of this trend. But today, only one can be the better buy.Let's find out which one it's going to be.The investment case for PayPalSince the spinoff from eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY) two years ago, PayPal has pursued a strategy of offering customers more choices in how they pay for things with their account. PayPal has formed several partnerships with card issuers, big banks, and other technology companies including Facebook, Apple, and Alphabet, which has driven growth in key operating metrics, as shown in this table.Metric 2017 YoY Change Revenue $13.09 billion 22% (excluding currency) Earnings per share $1.90 27% Total payment volume $451 billion 27% Customer accounts 227 million 15% Transactions per customer account 33.6 8%This open-platform strategy has clearly been paying off with the number of customer accounts accelerating to a growth rate of 15% in 2017, compared to 10% in 2016. What's particularly encouraging for PayPal's growth is that new customers who have joined PayPal over the last year are using their accounts more frequently than older customers, which implies newer customers are signing up with PayPal because they like the flexible options when transacting. It also implies that as more customers sign up, the growth in transactions per account may accelerate.Right now, PayPal's customers use their account on average about once every two weeks, but there's potential to drive that even higher. For example, customers of PayPal's Venmo -- a popular peer-to-peer payment app -- use their account four to five times per week. New features have been added to improve ease of use. One such feature, One Touch, which allows users to more quickly access their account without entering login information, has been adopted by 80 million PayPal users and is helping increase engagement.One Touch has been absolutely huge for PayPal in building relationships with merchants. Merchants love PayPal for two very important reasons. First, PayPal users complete transactions at checkout with their mobile phone at twice the rate (87%) of the industry average (44%). Second, One Touch allows merchants to offer customers a one-click checkout when they use PayPal, which enables those merchants to better compete with Amazon.com's popular one-click buy button.In 2017, strong growth in customer accounts and engagement drove total payment volume growth of 29% (excluding currency). This growth is happening as big banks and major credit card brands are incentivizing their customers to use PayPal, which cements the PayPal brand as a payments leader in the global economy.The investment case for MastercardCash, checks, and legacy Automated Clearing House transactions represent 90% of the total $225 trillion commerce market. This means Mastercard and PayPal should be able to grow for decades, as more consumers gradually migrate to electronic forms of payment.Metric 2017 YoY Change Revenue $12.5 billion 15% (excluding currency) Earnings per share $4.58 21% Gross dollar volume $5.242 trillion 10% Cards 2.429 billion 5%A key difference between the two companies is Mastercard's extremely high operating margin of 53%, while PayPal earned an operating margin of 16.2% in 2017. This reflects Mastercard's capital-light operating structure as a pure transaction processor, whereas PayPal is an intermediary between users and their credit card issuers.Unlike Mastercard, PayPal incurs a transaction expense, which it pays to banks and credit card issuers when users pay with their PayPal account. Excluding transaction expense, PayPal would have an operating margin of 50%, similar to Mastercard.Mastercard is in a powerful position as a de facto tollbooth operator in the global economy, collecting a fee whenever someone swipes a credit card at a store. And with 1.8 billion branded cards around the world, Mastercard has built a trusted brand for decades that cannot be easily duplicated.And the better buy is ...Both companies perform consistently well. Mastercard has grown revenue at an average of 10.7% per year over the last four years. This serves as a good guide for what to expect over the long term. As for earnings, analysts currently expect Mastercard's growth rate over the next five years to be 20% per year.PayPal has been growing faster. In 2017, PayPal's non-GAAP revenue grew 24%, and management expects the top line to grow approximately 20% in 2018. Analysts currently expect PayPal to grow earnings per share 18% over the next five years, somewhat lower than Mastercard.Overall, I wouldn't give either company the advantage in terms of expected future growth. Given the huge market opportunity, investors should expect Mastercard and PayPal to continue posting double-digit growth rates in both revenue and earnings for several years.Turning to valuation, Mastercard currently trades for a slightly lower P/E ratio on both a trailing and forward basis, as shown in the table.Metric Mastercard PayPal Market cap $186.74 billion $94.2 billion Trailing P/E 38.9 41.1 Forward P/E 25.2 28.3 Dividend yield 0.57% NAMastercard also pays a small dividend yield of 0.57% at the time of this writing, whereas PayPal has yet to initiate a dividend. However, the recent deal with Synchrony Financial, where PayPal sold $6.8 billion of credit receivables on its balance sheet, may give management the extra cash to begin paying a dividend in the near future.Additionally, Mastercard CEO Ajay Banga is viewed favorably by 94% of employees, according to the management-review website Glassdoor. This is higher than PayPal CEO Dan Schulman's rating of 85%. This may seem minor, but these approval ratings reflect overall employee satisfaction, which can contribute to company performance over the long term.Both companies should be good investments over the long term. But right now, Mastercard has the edge in valuation and CEO approval, which, for me, makes it the better buy.","PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ:PYPL) and Mastercard (NYSE:MA) are at the center of this trend.First, PayPal users complete transactions at checkout with their mobile phone at twice the rate (87%) of the industry average (44%).This means Mastercard and PayPal should be able to grow for decades, as more consumers gradually migrate to electronic forms of payment.Unlike Mastercard, PayPal incurs a transaction expense, which it pays to banks and credit card issuers when users pay with their PayPal account.But right now, Mastercard has the edge in valuation and CEO approval, which, for me, makes it the better buy.","['2017', 'users', 'customers', 'paypal', 'holdings', 'buy', 'billion', 'revenue', 'better', 'growth', 'vs', 'operating', 'mastercard', 'account']",,,['John Ballard'],3/7/18 0:00,https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/03/07/better-buy-mastercard-vs-paypal-holdings.aspx,,,,

"A single high school in India has produced the CEOs of Microsoft, Adobe, and Mastercard","Attending the school ""was the best break I had in my life,"" said Satya Nadella, the CEO of Microsoft. MicrosoftIf you're looking to raise one of the most powerful business leaders in the world, you might want to send your kid to Hyderabad Public School, Begumpet, in India.In an interview with Stephen Dubner on an episode of the ""Freakonomics"" podcast, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella mentioned that not only did he attend the high school, but so did Shantanu Narayen, the CEO of Adobe, and Ajay Banga, the CEO of Mastercard.Hyderabad Public School is what Americans would consider a private school ‰ÛÓ though in India, like England, such schools are called public schools.According to Hyderabad Public School's website, it was established in 1923 as a school for the sons of aristocrats, modeled after Eton College in London.

American Express and MasterCard are quietly killing one of the most annoying things about buying things in stores,"Pascal Le Segretain / Getty ImagesIn 2018, major credit card companies including MasterCard, Discover, and American Express will no longer require customers to sign their receipts.On Monday, American Express became the latest company to announce that it will stop requiring card members to sign receipts, beginning in April 2018. Previously, the company forced merchants to require all shoppers to sign for all transactions when checking out.With the rise of online shopping and new tech like EMV chips in credit cards, signatures have become less necessary as a safety measure, American Express said in a press release.In October, MasterCard announced that it would similarly stop requiring customers' signatures as of April 2018.

Is Lowe's Companies (LOW) Stock a Suitable Value Pick Now?,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn‰Ûªt want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let‰Ûªs put Lowe's Companies, Inc. LOW stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock‰Ûªs current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Lowe's Companies has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 19.6, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 stands at about 21.1. If we focus on the long-term PE trend, Lowe's Companies‰Ûª current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years. Moreover, the current level is fairly below the highs for this stock, suggesting it might be a good entry point.Further, the stock‰Ûªs PE also compares favorably with its industry‰Ûªs trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 23.4. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that Lowe's Companies has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year‰Ûªs earnings) of just 15.7, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for Lowe's Companies stock in the near term too.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock‰Ûªs price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, Lowe's Companies has a P/S ratio of about 1.0. This is lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.4 right now. As we can see in the chart below, this is slightly below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.As we can see, the stock is trading at its median value for the time period from a P/S metric. This does not provide us with a conclusive direction as to the relative valuation of the stock in comparison to its historical trend.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Lowe's Companies currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of B, putting it into the top 40% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes Lowe's Companies a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.For example, the PEG ratio for Lowe's Companies is just 0.9, a level that is lower than the industry average of 1.3. The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock‰Ûªs earnings growth rate. Clearly, LOW is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles.What About the Stock Overall?Though Lowe's Companies might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of D and a Momentum score of F. This gives LOW a Zacks VGM score‰ÛÓor its overarching fundamental grade‰ÛÓof D. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company‰Ûªs recent earnings estimates have been quite encouraging. The current fiscal quarter has seen eight estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to only one lower, while the fiscal full year estimate has seen twelve upward and three downward revisions in the same time period.This has had a meaningful impact on the consensus estimate as the current fiscal quarter consensus estimate has risen by 7.4% in the past two months, while the fiscal full year estimate has increased 4.3%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:Story Continues","If we focus on the long-term PE trend, Lowe's Companies‰Ûª current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years.Further, the stock‰Ûªs PE also compares favorably with its industry‰Ûªs trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 23.4.This makes Lowe's Companies a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.For example, the PEG ratio for Lowe's Companies is just 0.9, a level that is lower than the industry average of 1.3.Though Lowe's Companies might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name.","['pick', 'stock', 'investors', 'companies', 'low', 'estimate', 'suitable', 'past', 'ratio', 'stocks', 'pe', 'value', 'lowes']",,,['Zacks Equity Research'],2018-03-08 14:30:02+00:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lowe-apos-companies-low-stock-143002460.html,,,,
US Bank to pilot Mastercard‰Ûªs new feature for fleet cards,"Mastercard has introduced a new service that automatically integrates fuel and maintenance data from a connected car‰Ûªs dashboard into the payment process of a fleet card used at gas stations.Currently, the data has to be manually entered by car drivers, which at times result in mistakes and potential overspending on fuel.The new feature is aimed at optimizing the process and offer better transparency and control for fleet managers.

Mastercard Moves Toward Fast Blockchain Payments,"On October 20, 2017, Mastercard announced that developers would be able to access its blockchain technology platform via its Mastercard blockchain API published on Mastercard Developers .The new service was launched during the Money20/20 Hackathon in Las Vegas after testing and validation had been completed. According to the company, Mastercard's blockchain solution ""provides a new way for consumers, businesses and banks to transact and is key to the company's strategy to provide payment solutions that meet every need of financial institutions and their end-customers.""Mastercard wants to provide an easy-to-use, permissioned platform to its network of developers and partners, designed for privacy, flexibility and scalability. According to the company, Mastercard's blockchain technology platform provides privacy by ensuring that transaction details are shared only amongst the participants of a transaction while maintaining a fully auditable and valid ledger of transactions; flexibility by providing the blockchain APIs and a wider suite of Mastercard APIs, with software development kits available in six different languages; and scalability to commercial processing speed. Mastercard emphasizes that its blockchain technology is integrated into the company's widely popular payment network.At this moment, the Mastercard blockchain website for developers states that, due to an overwhelming amount of interest in Mastercard's blockchain, ""We are limiting access to our API documentation to a select audience at this time.""Besides specific use cases such as Proof-of-Provenance and vehicle service history, Mastercard notes that the global market opportunity for peer-to-peer (P2P) bank transfers is $16 trillion. Mastercard intends to take advantage of blockchain technology and the Mastercard Settlement Network to transfer funds between bank accounts.""The Mastercard Settlement Network reads the blockchain and will transfer the funds between two banks,"" stated Mastercard. ""It then writes a confirmation of transfer to the Mastercard blockchain.""According to Mastercard, the company operates the world's fastest payments processing network, connecting consumers, financial institutions, merchants, governments and businesses in more than 210 countries and territories. Besides developing its own blockchain platform, Mastercard had previously filed for over 35 patents related to blockchain technology, invested in Digital Currency Group and joined the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance to explore the possibilities of Ethereum technology across a wide range of potential use cases.""This move comes as a bit of a surprise, as Mastercard previously issued a blanket rejection of Bitcoin,"" reads a commentary published in Futurism . ""Still, Mastercard's blockchain service heralds what Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin described to be blockchain's potential to replace credit cards.""It appears that the payment processing giant, realizing that blockchain technology is here to stay and disrupt the credit card industry, is accelerating its blockchain-related plans. Last week, Mastercard filed a new patent for a "" Method and System For Instantaneous Payment Using Recorded Guarantees .""While it may seem that Mastercard is trying to patent blockchain technology itself, the filing is more specific and targets fast, verifiable and guaranteed payments on a blockchain network.Mastercard noted that, while fiat currency enables merchants to receive instant payments, it may take several days for a merchant to receive electronic payments due to processing, clearing and settlement times. On the other hand, credit cards are more convenient for consumers. Therefore, according to the filing, there is a need for a technical solution that allows merchants to receive instantaneous, guaranteed electronic payments while maintaining a high level of consumer convenience.","On October 20, 2017, Mastercard announced that developers would be able to access its blockchain technology platform via its Mastercard blockchain API published on Mastercard Developers .Mastercard emphasizes that its blockchain technology is integrated into the company's widely popular payment network.Mastercard intends to take advantage of blockchain technology and the Mastercard Settlement Network to transfer funds between bank accounts.""It then writes a confirmation of transfer to the Mastercard blockchain.""While it may seem that Mastercard is trying to patent blockchain technology itself, the filing is more specific and targets fast, verifiable and guaranteed payments on a blockchain network.","['payment', 'mastercard', 'blockchain', 'fast', 'payments', 'technology', 'network', 'mastercards', 'developers', 'moves', 'platform', 'processing']",,,[],2017-11-20 02:06:43-05:00,https://www.nasdaq.com/article/mastercard-moves-toward-fast-blockchain-payments-cm880288,,,,

Mastercard‰Ûªs Kionect Extends Microretailers New Options for Shelf Stocking,"Mastercard‰Ûªs Kionect Extends Microretailers New Options for Shelf StockingJanuary 19, 2018 By: Steven AndersonFor anyone who‰Ûªs ever been involved in retail over the cashier level, it might sound like a familiar story: if things ever start doing well at your shop, you want to expand. But expansion requires stock. If you don‰Ûªt have the cash on hand‰ÛÓbecause you just expanded your operation and all‰ÛÓyou need a loan. Those aren‰Ûªt always easy to get, especially for small shops. A new development from Mastercard, however, may help.The development in question is known as Kionect, a portmanteau of ‰ÛÏKiosk‰Ûù and ‰ÛÏConnect.‰Ûù Recently released for shops in Nairobi, Mastercard‰Ûªs Kionect system allows small retailers to place and pay for orders from Kaskazi, a wholesaler partnered with the effort. Kionect users can place the order by text message, and a mobile payment system backed by East Africa‰Ûªs Diamond Trust Bank allows the order to be paid for and recorded accordingly.This establishes a digital trail that provides a kind of credit history that can be used to obtain small business loans, great for smaller cash-only shops like the kind often seen in Africa. Those who doubt that the digital history in question would be accepted for loan credentials anywhere, however, will be amazed by the next step. The credit history is specifically accepted by Kenyan microfinance operation Musoni.This isn‰Ûªt the only such measure working to establish credit histories for small shops that often operate on a cash-only basis in the developing world. Tanzania has one known as First Access, and it also uses mobile payments systems as a basis to determine credit worth.It‰Ûªs an interesting enough notion, to use mobile payments history as a basis for credit. After all, what does that history show? It shows what someone has spent in a certain frame of time. If that spending is sufficiently regular, then it demonstrates that someone has a clear income. You can‰Ûªt spend‰ÛÓat least, not for long‰ÛÓwithout income. If someone has a sufficiently stable income that they can spend regularly, then it stands to reason they can repay a loan.Is the Kionect system the beginning of a great expansion for small retailers? Or is it merely a financial Band-Aid? Only time will tell where this goes, but it‰Ûªs amazing to see yet another thing mobile payments can do.","Those aren‰Ûªt always easy to get, especially for small shops.The credit history is specifically accepted by Kenyan microfinance operation Musoni.It‰Ûªs an interesting enough notion, to use mobile payments history as a basis for credit.Is the Kionect system the beginning of a great expansion for small retailers?Only time will tell where this goes, but it‰Ûªs amazing to see yet another thing mobile payments can do.","['small', 'shelf', 'stocking', 'history', 'microretailers', 'payments', 'system', 'basis', 'mobile', 'mastercards', 'extends', 'kionect', 'credit', 'options', 'shops', 'income']",,,[],1/19/18 0:00,https://paymentweek.com/2018-1-19-mastercards-kionect-extends-microretailers-new-options-shelf-stocking/,,,,
"Visa, Mastercard Are ‰Û÷Crown Jewels‰Ûª: Bernstein","Despite the mania surrounding digital currency and next-gen payments technology, plastic cards aren't going anywhere soon, according to one team of bulls who expects two of the traditional industry leaders to beat the larger market in the next 12 months.On Wednesday, analysts at Bernstein initiated coverage on Visa Inc. (V) and Mastercard Inc. (MA) at outperform, highlighting their prospects in the consumer-to-business (C2B) payments segment despite heightened regulatory pressure and more competition from tech giants such as Alibaba Group (BABA), as reported by Barron's. (See also: 4 Bank Stocks to Outperform in 2018: Oppenheimer.)Growth in C2B Space to Fuel GainsBernstein's Harshita Rawat expects C2B payments, still only 43% penetrated by cards, to grow by approximately 2 percentages points annually to reach 51% by 2022. Against the backdrop of strong secular growth, she sees Visa shares rising more than 22% over 12 months to teach $143, while expecting Mastercard to also gain nearly 22% to reach $207. Visa closed down 0.4% on Wednesday at $116.99, reflecting a 2.6% gain year-to-date (YTD), and a 31.3% increase over 12 months, while Mastercard, trading down 1.3% at $170.35, has returned 12.6% in 2018 and 51.5% over the year. The two have outperformed the greater market, as the S&P 500 sinks 2.6% YTD and gains 10.5% over the most recent 12 months.While the two companies are ""the crown jewels of the secularly growing payments market,"" wrote Rawat, they will face more competition from rivals such as Chinese online giant BABA with its Alipay platform and other tech titans using their deep pockets to grab a share of the growth business.Also on Wednesday, the analyst started coverage on digital payments pioneer PayPal Holdings Inc. (PYPL) at market perform. She warned that Wall Street has ""underappreciated business pressures surfacing for the leading online checkout button."" The San Jose, California-based firm's exposure to online retail and its ability to use M&A to position itself more firmly in its space are positives, yet new competitive forces and a 74% gain over the most recent 12 months pose investment risks, wrote Rawat.Cryptocurrency Remains to Slow to Pose as a RiskEvercore ISI analysts were also out with a note this week, suggesting that the speed of cards over digital currency transaction times will protect issuers such as Visa, Mastercard and American Express Co. (AXP). Analyst David Togut wrote that ""Visa can process 65,000 transaction messages per second, at full capacity, compared with fewer than 10 bitcoin transactions per second.""

Mastercard (MA) Boosts Blockchain Usage in its Operations,"Mastercard IncorportedMA , essentially a technology company, is fast incorporating the blockchain technology into its operations. The company is going a step further by trying this novel technology after having made massive investments in its digital platform over past many years. The need for the same is driven by changing trends in the digital economy, which calls for faster payments via electronic means.The company was the front runner in the adoption of this technology by announcing its blockchain API in 2016. Blockchain is the technology underlying the cryprocurrencies. As the name implies, it is a chain of blocks which gets built step by step. As each transaction takes place, it is put into a block, which is then connected to the previous block, the transactions are blocked together to form an irreversible chain.Though this technology is still in its nascent stage and its full potential remains yet to be harnessed, it is widely believed to be a game changer. The benefits of blockchain cannot be undermined in the payments space given the speed, flexibility, security and cost effectiveness it provides to the transactions.Last year, Mastercard launched its own blockchain network to implement the technology in the business-to-business (B2B) space to address challenges of speed, transparency and costs in cross-border payments. Mastercard intends to take advantage of the blockchain technology and the Mastercard Settlement Network to transfer funds between bank accounts. The Mastercard Settlement Network reads the blockchain and will transfer the funds between two banks. It then writes a confirmation of transfer to the Mastercard blockchain.The Mastercard blockchain technology will complement the company's existing capabilities including virtual cards, Mastercard Send and Vocalink to support all types of cross-border, B2B payment flows - account-based, blockchain-based and card-based. The company is, however, not using the digital currency but keeping its transaction base in fiat currency.The company recently joined Enterprise Etherum Alliance, an open source block-chain consortium, to explore the potential of the etherum technology across a gamut of uses among which some are outside the scope of Mastercard's traditional payments environment.Year to date, Mastercard's stock has gained 65% significantly, outperforming the industry 's growth of 38%.Another company in the same space, Visa Inc. V , is working on the blockchain technology. American Express Co. AXP last November, joined blockchain network RippleNet to explore the use of this technology for faster, more efficient B2B payments. Recently, The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office released the patent application filed by American Express Travel Related Services Company, the payment technology firm's travel unit, which outlines the use of blockchain technology to accelerate payments between two parties. Its application emphasizes the potential for blockchain to enhance existing card networks.Mastercard carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Another player worth considering from in the same space is Global Payments Inc. GPN , which carries the same Zacks Rank as Mastercard and surpassed earnings expectation in each of the past four quarters, with an average beat of 4%. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here .Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.See This Ticker Free >>Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

MasterCard Publishes Patent To Speed Up Blockchain Node Activation,"MasterCard has filed a patent for a system to speed up the activation of new nodes in a blockchain, in an application published by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) April 26.The application, which was first filed on October 24, 2016, outlines that the current difficulty facing new nodes ‰ÛÒ a computer connected to the blockchain network that stores a copy of the blockchain ‰ÛÒ is that they are required to individually verify a massive amount of data in order to activate. The patent states that new nodes must verify ‰ÛÏthousands, millions, or even billions of transaction records [‰Û_] in a vast number of different blocks‰Ûù that may have accumulated over time in a given blockchain, generating a significant delay before each new node can begin to participate in the network.The patent proposes a technical solution for faster navigation, in which ‰ÛÏfast track flags‰Ûù would be included in block headers, so that new nodes could scan and verify the blockchain at greater speed:‰ÛÏA node in the blockchain network [‰Û_] may quickly navigate the blockchain by identifying blocks that have activated fast track flags. For verification, the node may identify the earlier fast track block (e.g., based on timestamp) and hash that block [‰Û_] and then verify that the fast track reference in the more recent fast track block is the same as the hash of the earlier fast track block.‰ÛùThe patent also outlines the use of software specifically configured to perform querying, hashing, and signatory operations, that would further enhance system efficiency.MasterCard Labs has reportedly filed for over 30 ‰ÛÏpatents related to blockchain tech and cryptocurrency‰Ûù to date. On April 12, USPTO published a MasterCard patent application for tamper-proof distributed storage of identity data on a blockchain system that would prevent abuses, such as identity fraud. In Oct. 2017, the company launched a blockchain system offering business-to-business payments, and submitted a blockchain tech patent for instant payments a month later, in Nov. 2017.Overall, the company appears to be vigorously pro-blockchain, yet anti-Bitcoin: in Oct. 2017, the company‰Ûªs CEO scorned non-government issued cryptocurrencies as ‰ÛÏjunk.‰Ûù This March, a senior MasterCard executive reiterated that the company is receptive to central bank-issued digital currencies only.","MasterCard has filed a patent for a system to speed up the activation of new nodes in a blockchain, in an application published by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) April 26.The patent proposes a technical solution for faster navigation, in which ‰ÛÏfast track flags‰Ûù would be included in block headers, so that new nodes could scan and verify the blockchain at greater speed:‰ÛÏA node in the blockchain network [‰Û_] may quickly navigate the blockchain by identifying blocks that have activated fast track flags.MasterCard Labs has reportedly filed for over 30 ‰ÛÏpatents related to blockchain tech and cryptocurrency‰Ûù to date.On April 12, USPTO published a MasterCard patent application for tamper-proof distributed storage of identity data on a blockchain system that would prevent abuses, such as identity fraud.In Oct. 2017, the company launched a blockchain system offering business-to-business payments, and submitted a blockchain tech patent for instant payments a month later, in Nov. 2017.","['node', 'blockchain', 'patent', 'fast', 'verify', 'system', 'block', 'nodes', 'speed', 'track', 'activation', 'mastercard', 'publishes']",,,[],2018-04-30 11:19:00+01:00,https://cointelegraph.com/news/mastercard-publishes-patent-to-speed-up-blockchain-node-activation,,,,

Why MasterCard Shares May Outperform Visa,"(Note: The author of this fundamental analysis is a financial writer and portfolio manager. He and his clients own shares of V and MA.)Shares of MasterCard Inc. (MA) have sped ahead of Visa Inc. (V) over the past year, rising by over 53% compared to 40% for Visa. MasterCard's stock has sharply lagged its financial rival since early March, aided by Visa's strong earnings report on April 25. But MasterCard's shares are poised to regain the lead and outperform over the next year as the payment processor reports what are expected to be robust results on May 2.Analysts are looking for MasterCard's earnings to rise over 23% to $1.24 per share, while revenue is seen jumping by 19% to $3.25 billion, in the first quarter. MasterCard historically reports results that come in ahead of estimates. Since the fourth quarter of 2015, MasterCard has only missed revenue estimates two times, while earnings have yet to disappoint. (For related reading, see also: MasterCard Sees Double-Digit Gains in Q1 Earnings.)V data by YChartsStrong NumbersAnalysts are looking for MasterCard earnings to soar this quarter, at an even faster pace than what Visa forecasts had been. MasterCard has a history of topping earnings estimates by a wide margin. In fact, over the past nine quarters, MasterCard has beaten earnings estimates by an average of about 6.3%, while revenue has also beaten estimates by nearly 2.25% on average. It gives MasterCard a good shot at producing a better growth than even Visa.V Quarterly Actual EPS data by YChartsVisa's Strong ResultsThe prominent growth numbers analysts are forecasting for MasterCard should come as no surprise, especially given Visa's latest set of quarterly results. Analysts had been looking for Visa's earnings to grow by 18.6% in its fiscal second quarter; instead, Visa reported earnings that were more than 9% better than expectations, providing a growth rate of nearly 29% versus last year. Over the past nine quarters, Visa has beaten analysts' earnings estimates by just over 7% on average, while revenue has topped estimates by approximately 2.75% on average.V Quarterly Revenue Estimates data by YChartsBullish AnalystsAnalysts are incredibly bullish on shares of MasterCard with 97% of the 36 analysts covering the stock rating shares a ""buy"" or ""outperform."" The average price target on the stock is currently $195.29, nearly 10% higher than the stock's current price.Technicals Suggest a Breakout Is ComingTechnicals show shares of MasterCard are in the process of breaking out, and should shares rise above a downtrend currently around $178 to $180, then shares of the stock could be poised to increase to nearly $195. Visa's chart had a similar set up going into its results, followed by a post-earnings breakout. (For more, see also: Visa‰Ûªs Breakout May Boost Stock by 10%.)With earnings of MasterCard quickly approaching shares of the stock appear poised to continue outperforming. Now the company will need to report strong numbers, and provide even better guidance to keep its shares rising.Michael Kramer is the Founder of Mott Capital Management LLC, a registered investment adviser, and the manager of the company's actively managed, long-only Thematic Growth Portfolio.

Mastercard tosses a lifeline to data-challenged merchants,"Merchants that can't put their customer data to use risk irrelevance in a digital age, giving Mastercard an opportunity to put an acquired analytics unit to work as an acquisition lure.Around the same time Target, Walmart and Best Buy were trying to turn data into revenue via the Merchant Customer Exchange, Mastercard acquired Applied Predictive Technologies. It was a move with an eye on the future, a chance for Mastercard to integrate APT's Test & Learn cloud-based data analytics platform to inform any type of decision a business client might make.Since the acquisition, Mastercard has built out a service that helps merchants establish data mining and testing for data-driven decisions such as product price changes, new promotions, technology or capital investments, or changing interactions with consumers.Anthony Bruce, president of applied analytics at Mastercard""We just say they should try that idea first, which is an easy thing to say but a hard thing to do, and learn as much as possible from that test,"" said Anthony Bruce, president of applied analytics at Mastercard.At first glance, the concept of trying something before fully committing to it seems like something right out of Business 101 classes. But in the digital age, where data comes from any number of channels and delivers potentially different messages to the merchant, it becomes imperative to take a deep dive into that data and connect every dot.What may have been considered a ""no-brainer"" idea years ago to reduce the cost of a product to generate sales and lure in new customers, needs far more detailed attention in the digital age, Bruce said.As an example, a nationwide sandwich shop chain might consider reducing the price of its most popular sandwich by $2 to see if it could increase foot traffic and thus sales of other items in the restaurant, Bruce said.With applied analytics and a test run in only a few locations, the data could tell that merchant the promotion might work only in certain geographic areas at certain times of the year. It would halt the loss of money if the company were to just launch the promotion across all properties.""You could compare the sites you are testing with the promotion to the sites you did not try it at yet, and compare all of the data,"" Bruce said. ""It might turn out that sales were no different, and that could result from weather conditions, what was going on in the city at that time, where the sites were located, and many other things.""That type of insight is powerful for a company and allows it to compare transaction numbers and sales percentages against those of competitors, he added. ""Your sales may be down, but maybe theirs were too for some unforeseen reason.""Ultimately, Mastercard operates its data analytics on the premise that it can help its merchant clients turn data into action ‰ÛÓ and better decisions. In doing so, the business would grow and potentially increase transactions on the Mastercard network.""There are multiple elements about how we can leverage this discipline for deeper relationships with our merchant partners, as we help organizations with their loyalty programs in obvious ways and in optimizing customer relationships,"" Bruce said.Merchants are increasingly realizing that data is a ""renewable source that allows them to stand on their own,"" said Richard Crone, chief executive of San Carlos, Calif.-based payments consulting firm Crone Consulting LLC.""Retailers stand to gain by turbocharging their data, as they and their payment processors are starting to glean wisdom from the data,"" Crone added. ""That is what the applied data analysis is doing for Mastercard, as well as taking it to the next level by developing machine learning so that it can do this type of analysis on the fly.""Data will play an even larger role in the advancement of omnichannel experiences at retailers or Internet of Things advancements.""You have to leverage all of the data you have for the consumer's benefit,"" Mastercard's Bruce said. ""That is the core of the mission.""That translates to merchants using what they learn about their customers through all channels and then communicating to the customer at all touchpoints, mobile, online and in physical retail settings.","Merchants that can't put their customer data to use risk irrelevance in a digital age, giving Mastercard an opportunity to put an acquired analytics unit to work as an acquisition lure.Around the same time Target, Walmart and Best Buy were trying to turn data into revenue via the Merchant Customer Exchange, Mastercard acquired Applied Predictive Technologies.It was a move with an eye on the future, a chance for Mastercard to integrate APT's Test & Learn cloud-based data analytics platform to inform any type of decision a business client might make.""You could compare the sites you are testing with the promotion to the sites you did not try it at yet, and compare all of the data,"" Bruce said.Ultimately, Mastercard operates its data analytics on the premise that it can help its merchant clients turn data into action ‰ÛÓ and better decisions.","['customer', 'bruce', 'tosses', 'lifeline', 'applied', 'type', 'turn', 'datachallenged', 'analytics', 'data', 'merchant', 'mastercard', 'merchants', 'sales']",,,['David Heun'],2018-04-23 00:01:47.397000-04:00,https://www.paymentssource.com/news/mastercard-applies-data-analytics-to-expand-merchant-relationships,,,,
Mastercard Incorporated (MA): Are There Still Some Opportunities On The Horizon ‰ÛÒ Stock News Gazette,"Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) seems to be forming a pattern of major movements, providing only some crumbs of outlook for market participants trying to figure out its next move. Now trading with a market value of 197.78B, the company has a mix of catalysts and obstacles that spring from the nature of its operations. As the day-to-day narrative ebbs and flows for this company, it is more important than ever to step back and get a bird‰Ûªs eye view of the fundamental reality under the surface of this story.It‰Ûªs generally a good idea to start with the most fundamental piece of the picture: the balance sheet. The balance sheet health of any company plays a key role in its ability to meet its obligations and maintain the faith of its investment base. For MA, the company currently has 7.44 billion of cash on the books. The trend over time is important to note. In this case, the company‰Ûªs debt has been growing. The company also has 22.94 billion in total assets, balanced by 17.14 billion in total liabilities, which should give you a sense of the viability of the company under any number of imagined business contexts.Mastercard Incorporated (MA) saw 1.09 billion in free cash flow last quarter, representing a quarterly net change in cash of 973 million. Perhaps most importantly where cash movements are concerned, the company saw about 1.18 billion in net operating cash flow.As far as key trends that demonstrate something of the future investment potential of this stock, we need to take a closer look at the top line, first and foremost. Last quarter, the company saw 3.58 billion in total revenues. That represents a quarterly year/year change in revenues of 0.31 in sequential terms, the MA saw sales decline by 0.08.But what about the bottom line? After all, that‰Ûªs what really matters in the end. Mastercard Incorporated (MA) is intriguing when broken down to its core data. For shareholders, given the total diluted outstanding shares of 1.06 billion, this means overall earnings per share of 1.41. Note, this compares with a consensus analyst forecast of 1.71 in earnings per share for its next fiscal quarterly report.Looking ahead at valuations, according to the consensus, the next fiscal year is forecast to bring about 7.25 in total earnings per share. If we consider a median price to earnings ratio on the stock, that corresponds with a stock price of 26.13. However, one should always remember: the trends are more important than the forecasts. This continues to be an interesting story, and we look forward to updating it again soon on Mastercard Incorporated.","Mastercard Incorporated (MA) saw 1.09 billion in free cash flow last quarter, representing a quarterly net change in cash of 973 million.Perhaps most importantly where cash movements are concerned, the company saw about 1.18 billion in net operating cash flow.That represents a quarterly year/year change in revenues of 0.31 in sequential terms, the MA saw sales decline by 0.08.Mastercard Incorporated (MA) is intriguing when broken down to its core data.If we consider a median price to earnings ratio on the stock, that corresponds with a stock price of 26.13.","['cash', 'stock', 'earnings', 'incorporated', 'billion', 'total', 'company', 'opportunities', 'ma', 'gazette', 'share', 'mastercard', 'horizon', 'saw']",,,[],5/16/18 0:00,https://stocknewsgazette.com/2018/05/16/mastercard-incorporated-ma-are-there-still-some-opportunities-on-the-horizon-3/,,,,

MasterCard employee's death by falling tree in Singapore Botanic Gardens a tragic misadventure: Coroner,"A 38-year-old woman went to attend an outdoor concert at the Singapore Botanic Gardens' Shaw Foundation Symphony Stage when suddenly a 40m tree came crashing down and that became the cause of her death. On Monday, April 30 State Coroner Marvin Bay found the death of the woman to be a tragic misadventure.At the time of the incident, the victim, Radhika Angara, who was identified as an Indian national as well as the regional digital marketing head for Asia-Pacific at MasterCard, was with her 39-year-old French husband Jerome Rouch-Sirech and their one-year-old twins. The accident took place on February 11, 2017, that also injured the family of the deceased.Reports said that a tree expert, Derek Yap told the court on July 18, 2017, that the tree was already decaying from inside. But inspectors could not find any signs of the rot to predict that the tree will fall down.After the tragic incident, the 270-year-old heritage tree was examined by an expert, who stated that the tree was about 70 percent decayed at the section where it broke. Yap, who runs a private consultancy for trees and almost for a decade had been with the National Parks Board (NParks) said that the rot would have affected the tree's strength.A senior NParks official told the court that the tree did not have the damaged trunk that was a result of the rot. But as per the deputy director of the Botanic Gardens' Arboriculture and Plant Resource, Elango Velautham the 1.5m long, 0.2m deep, 1m high and 0.3m wide hollow was the flute, which is an irregular feature of a tree. He analysed the tree after a report was made on September 29, 2016.Unlike other heritage trees in the country this particular tree had been inspected twice in a year, as the place where it is situated known as the high human traffic area.In the south-east Asian country several accident cases were registered after a tree branch fell suddenly on a human or on the road.On April 28, round 20 passers-by volunteered to move a huge tree branch that suddenly falls on the road and obstructed Ganges Avenue towards Indus Road. The entire clean-up operation took almost 10 minutes. Two local residents also took control of the traffic.Similar to Radhika's case, a falling tree branch became the cause of an 89-year-old man's death in North Bridge Road.","On Monday, April 30 State Coroner Marvin Bay found the death of the woman to be a tragic misadventure.Reports said that a tree expert, Derek Yap told the court on July 18, 2017, that the tree was already decaying from inside.In the south-east Asian country several accident cases were registered after a tree branch fell suddenly on a human or on the road.On April 28, round 20 passers-by volunteered to move a huge tree branch that suddenly falls on the road and obstructed Ganges Avenue towards Indus Road.Similar to Radhika's case, a falling tree branch became the cause of an 89-year-old man's death in North Bridge Road.","['road', 'gardens', 'tragic', 'branch', 'employees', 'rot', 'tree', 'trees', 'woman', 'yap', 'singapore', 'took', 'suddenly', 'coroner', 'mastercard', 'misadventure', 'death', 'falling']",,,['Bhaswati Guha Majumder'],2018-04-30 18:34:58+08:00,http://www.ibtimes.sg/mastercard-employees-death-by-falling-tree-singapore-botanic-gardens-tragic-misadventure-coroner-26145,,,,
Why You Should Get the New Barclays Arrival Premier World Elite Mastercard,"Illustration by Brown Bird DesignEven if you aren‰Ûªt obsessed with loyalty points and frequent flier miles, it‰Ûªs hard to ignore all those alluring offers: 10,000 points! 50,000 points! 100,000 points! What you‰Ûªll actually do with those points notwithstanding, these so-called sign-up bonuses can often translate into hundreds and even thousands of dollars of free travel , including upgrades to business- and first-class seats. Which is why it was so incredibly weird when, earlier this month, Barclays announced a new rewards card that would have no sign-up bonus at all.The Barclays Arrival Premier World Elite Mastercard is offering plenty of perks to people who sign up, like two points for every dollar spent, no foreign transaction fees, a $100 statement credit to cover the cost of Global Entry enrollment, among other typical credit card perks like travel assistance and rental car coverage. There is an annual fee of $150, and you also get access to more than 800 airport lounges at $27 per visit.But the real benefit of this card is that the points you earn can be used on a huge number of airlines including Aeromexico, Air France, Etihad, Japan Airlines, and Qantas, among others. Contrast that to, say, an airline-branded card which only accrues points for that carrier (and its alliance partners); for example, an American Airlines card will earn you miles you can use on AA or other Oneworld partners like British Airways and Cathay Pacific. While the sort of flexibility Barclays is offering isn‰Ûªt exactly rare‰ÛÓthe Chase Sapphire Reserve card also earns very flexible points ‰ÛÓit‰Ûªs an incredibly valuable perk that lets you spend points in a ton of different ways. ‰ÛÏIn my view Air France, Etihad, and JAL are the most useful partners here,‰Ûù writes points expert Gary Leff at View from the Wing . ‰ÛÏAnd [Barclays has] one of the best award charts out there,‰Ûù Leff adds, meaning you‰Ûªll get good value for your miles when using them for flights.The new Barclays card also rewards people who, frankly, spend a ton of money. Users will get a 15,000-point bonus when they spend $15,000 in a year on the card. Spend another $10,000 on top of that, and you'll get another 10,000-point bonus. ""Cardmembers will earn a total of 75,000 miles when they spend $25,000 on purchases each year,"" says Barclays, ""the equivalent of a $750 travel statement credit."" (Of course, you shouldn‰Ûªt cash in your miles for statement credit when you can spend them on flights and upgrades worth considerably more.)So while you won‰Ûªt get a one-time sign-up bonus with the Barclays Arrival card, those who can comfortably spend $2,000 a month get something even better: A huge pile of points every single year that‰Ûªs worth at least $750 in free travel‰ÛÓabout what it might cost you to jet to Australia and back .","Which is why it was so incredibly weird when, earlier this month, Barclays announced a new rewards card that would have no sign-up bonus at all.The Barclays Arrival Premier World Elite Mastercard is offering plenty of perks to people who sign up, like two points for every dollar spent, no foreign transaction fees, a $100 statement credit to cover the cost of Global Entry enrollment, among other typical credit card perks like travel assistance and rental car coverage.The new Barclays card also rewards people who, frankly, spend a ton of money.""Cardmembers will earn a total of 75,000 miles when they spend $25,000 on purchases each year,"" says Barclays, ""the equivalent of a $750 travel statement credit.""(Of course, you shouldn‰Ûªt cash in your miles for statement credit when you can spend them on flights and upgrades worth considerably more.)","['card', 'bonus', 'credit', 'statement', 'premier', 'arrival', 'world', 'elite', 'travel', 'points', 'spend', 'miles', 'youll', 'barclays', 'mastercard']",,,['Paul Brady'],,https://www.cntraveler.com/story/why-you-should-get-the-new-barclays-arrival-premier-world-elite-mastercard,,,,

"Best Buy: Visa, Mastercard, or American Express?","It's a rivalry as old as time itself. OK, not really, but the top three payment-card companies in America -- Visa (NYSE:V), Mastercard (NYSE:MA), and American Express (NYSE:AXP) -- have been slugging it out since the dawn of the modern card era.Over that time, many an investor has pondered which of the Big Three is the best stock buy for the money. Here's which one I think is the champ right now.Middlemen vs. creditorsFirst, let's take a top-down look at the payment-card industry. There are two types of operators -- open-loop and closed-loop. In the first, the card company is merely the facilitator of transactions; another company extends the credit, typically a bank or other sort of financial institution. Visa and Mastercard both fall under this category; they are card brands but provide no credit themselves.Closed-loop companies generally function as both the creditor and the payment processor; this is the case with AmEx and smaller peer Discover Financial Services.The game with open-loop companies, since they're essentially middlemen taking a cut of every transaction on their network, is volume. The more payments effected with their brands, the more money they make, all things being equal. Credit risk is someone else's problem.Yet it's also someone else's opportunity, at least as far as AmEx is concerned. As a closed-loop operator, it also pockets those per-transaction ""swipe"" fees, but unlike Visa and Mastercard, it rakes in interest income from the credit it extends to its cardholders as well as annual membership fees from those customers.This is why AmEx's revenue is well higher than that of both Visa and Mastercard. However, since AmEx's costs of being a money lending, one-stop shop are proportionally much higher, its margins are significantly thinner.It also has a smaller footprint -- at the end of last year there were around 47.5 million AmEx cards in circulation, according to data from WalletHub. That number is well under Mastercard's estimated 200 million, and Visa's 335 million (again, volume is key for the open-loopers).The world is quickly moving away from cash to alternatives such as plastic and digital. According to Euromonitor International, transactions made by card overtook those by cash for the first time last year.One forecast from the Nilson Report predicts that the number of payment cards in circulation will rise by 16% from the end of 2015 to 2020 -- a trend that favors the volume guys, rather than closed-loop operators, since they necessarily have to be more careful and cautious about issuing cards.Meanwhile, Mastercard and Visa have gotten more deeply involved in 21st-century payment processing. Visa in particular has done a good job inserting itself into this segment, forming a partnership with one-time antagonist PayPal Holdings, and another with Europe-based online payments specialist Klarna.Analysts have a rosy view of the future of both open-loopers. According to Zacks Investment Research, prognosticators have collectively forecast earnings growth averaging 16.3% annually over the next five years for Visa, and 15.5% for Mastercard. AmEx's figure for same is a good-but-not-quite-there 10.3%.All of this means that, for me, the ultimate choice for investors is between Visa and Mastercard -- even though I have long been an AmEx bull and remain so.The drum roll, please...So which of the pair takes the crown? In my view, it's Visa, which is giving every indication that it's well armed and very ready to expand its lead in the payment-card space. The company's recent results have been nothing short of stellar, and those smart strategic partnerships, plus the recent consolidation of Visa Europe into its business, position it very nicely for the future.Both Visa and Mastercard have, justifiably, seen run-ups in their stock over the past few months as investors realize just how explosive their potential is. These days, Visa trades at a very high trailing 12-month P/E of over 40, while Mastercard floats a bit north of 36. Looking toward the future, though, the two stocks' P/E-to-growth rates are roughly equal at around the 1.9 level.For the aforementioned reasons, I think the bigger company has scope for bigger share-price gains. If anything, analysts are underestimating Visa's potential. It's the clear winning stock for me at the moment.","OK, not really, but the top three payment-card companies in America -- Visa (NYSE:V), Mastercard (NYSE:MA), and American Express (NYSE:AXP) -- have been slugging it out since the dawn of the modern card era.Over that time, many an investor has pondered which of the Big Three is the best stock buy for the money.Visa and Mastercard both fall under this category; they are card brands but provide no credit themselves.This is why AmEx's revenue is well higher than that of both Visa and Mastercard.Meanwhile, Mastercard and Visa have gotten more deeply involved in 21st-century payment processing.","['best', 'card', 'visa', 'express', 'stock', 'american', 'paymentcard', 'buy', 'amex', 'volume', 'credit', 'money', 'mastercard', 'payment']",,,"['Eric Volkman', 'Eric Has Been Writing About Stocks', 'Finance Since The', 'When He Lived In Prague', 'Czech Republic.

"MPU cards, Visa and MasterCard credit cards to be enabled under YPS","The Yangon Regional Government is currently in the process of awarding the contract to implement YPS to one of two companies: Anypay Payment Services or Asia Starmar Transport Intelligent CoAfter it decides on the right company for the job, preparations will be made for ATM and credit cards issued by the 23 local banks to be enabled under YPS, which is envisaged to be a single card payments system in Yangon.The aim is to enable card holders to use a single card for all cash transactions, including taking public transport and making payments in restaurants and supermarkets as well as withdrawing cash at the ATM.‰ÛÏExisting cards, including ATM cards under the Myanmar Payment Union (MPU) and Visa and MasterCard credit cards, will be enabled under YPS,‰Ûù U Phyo Min Thein told The Myanmar Times at a press conference last week.The regional government on April 21 also announced that Excel KC Myanmar, the original tender winner, will no longer be eligible to build and implement YPS in Yangon.After discussing terms of the contract, the government said Excel KC Myanmar did not have the necessary qualifications to implement the YPS system and that the company‰Ûªs status as tender winner for the project has been revoked. Excel KC Myanmar had won the tender for YPS on January 10.U Phyo Min Thein said fees would be involved when using MPU cards or credit cards under YPS.‰ÛÏTo launch this system, we will need an appropriate fee rate which is convenient and affordable for all.

Mastercard Pays The Price As Banks Refuse Crypto Buys,"Bitcoin is big money for credit card companies, or so Mastercard seems to think. In its earnings call this week, the world‰Ûªs second largest credit card issuer admitted that its quarterly growth was lower than expected, due to a drop in cryptocurrency purchases.Mastercard‰Ûªs cross-border trades grew by 19 percent in the first three months of the year, two percentage points less than last quarter. This shortfall ‰ÛÏis due to the recent drop-off in crypto wallet funding,‰Ûù Mastercard CFO Martina Hund-Mejean stated on the earnings call.Although the drop was comparatively minor, it was large enough to raise some eyebrows. ‰ÛÏLike a moth to the flame, I‰Ûªve got to ask about the crypto,‰Ûù said an analyst from Susquehanna Financial Group. ‰ÛÏThat‰Ûªs a bigger callout than we had anticipated on the crypto.‰ÛùWhile Mastercard does not specifically restrict users from purchasing virtual currencies, Hund-Mejean explained, several of its partners do. ‰ÛÏA number of the banks have decided, in particular in the United States, that they would not allow the usage of cards for this particular funding vehicle,‰Ûù she said.JP Morgan Chase, Citigroup and Bank of America were among the institutions which prohibited their customers from buying cryptocurrencies, CNBC reports. Although the banks cited volatility and credit risks to justify the restriction, the crypto community regarded the ban as a warning-shot from the world of traditional finance.A Wave of (Re) AdoptionsAlthough banks remain skeptical, Silicon Valley is more open to digital currency. Many tech companies after turned their backs on the cryptocurrency markets earlier this year, have since reversed their positions .Most notably, Microsoft‰ÛÓwhich had supported Bitcoin payments for Windows and Xbox since 2014‰ÛÓsuspended them abruptly in January, citing the ‰ÛÏunstable‰Ûù nature of the cryptocurrency. Shortly after, Bitcoin payments resumed as suddenly as they had ended, and Microsoft promised ‰ÛÏto ensure lower bitcoin amounts would be redeemable by customers.‰ÛùReddit, one of the web‰Ûªs largest social networks, may also reopen its wallet, BTCManager reports. The site was one of Bitcoin‰Ûªs earliest adopters in 2013, but closed its payment channel payments in March when fees and transaction times soared. Now that fees and transaction times have settled, Reddit‰Ûªs CTO has hinted that the site may soon reopen to Bitcoin, as well as Litecoin and Ethereum.Alexis Ohanian, one of Reddit‰Ûªs cofounders, was even more optimistic. In an interview with Fortune Ohanian predicted that Ether prices would double to $1,500 by the end of this year.Banks are starting to yield ground as well, although Wall Street is still largely enemy territory. JP Morgan, whose CEO made a scalding attack on Bitcoin, has since softened its posture and filed a patent for its own blockchain-based technology. And Goldman Sachs, long synonymous with stuffy financial conservatism, has plans for a Bitcoin futures desk.","This shortfall ‰ÛÏis due to the recent drop-off in crypto wallet funding,‰Ûù Mastercard CFO Martina Hund-Mejean stated on the earnings call.‰ÛÏLike a moth to the flame, I‰Ûªve got to ask about the crypto,‰Ûù said an analyst from Susquehanna Financial Group.Most notably, Microsoft‰ÛÓwhich had supported Bitcoin payments for Windows and Xbox since 2014‰ÛÓsuspended them abruptly in January, citing the ‰ÛÏunstable‰Ûù nature of the cryptocurrency.The site was one of Bitcoin‰Ûªs earliest adopters in 2013, but closed its payment channel payments in March when fees and transaction times soared.Now that fees and transaction times have settled, Reddit‰Ûªs CTO has hinted that the site may soon reopen to Bitcoin, as well as Litecoin and Ethereum.","['cryptocurrency', 'banks', 'refuse', 'credit', 'transaction', 'buys', 'payments', 'times', 'wallet', 'bitcoin', 'price', 'mastercard', 'pays', 'crypto']",,,"['Andrew Ancheta', 'Ico Analysts']",2018-05-05 08:46:48-05:00,https://cryptobriefing.com/mastercard-banks-refuse-crypto/,,,,

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Mastercard, NVIDIA and Danaher. These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today's research reports here >>>Strong-Buy ranked Mastercard 's shares have increased 63.6% over the last year, significantly outperforming the Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry's gain of 37.4% during the same period. Mastercard's earnings beat expectations and surged 43% year over year. Better-than-expected results were primarily backed by higher switched transactions, increase in cross-border volume and gross dollar volume as well as gains from acquisitions.The Zacks analyst thinks the company is well placed for growth, given its solid market position, ongoing expansion and digital initiatives plus significant opportunities from the secular shift toward electronic payments. The buyouts of VocaLink and NuData Security complement the company's efforts to participate in new payment flows and enhance its safety and security offerings.The stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings being revised upward over the last 30 days. However, escalating costs continue to bother. Also, higher incentives and rewards will put pressure on its bottom line.(You can read the full research report on Mastercard here >>> ).Shares of NVIDIA have surged in the last one year, gaining +89.5% versus the Zacks General Semiconductor industry's +57.4% gain, thanks to the company's positive record of earnings surprises in the recent quarters. NVIDIA posted a stellar first quarter and provided encouraging second-quarter fiscal 2019 revenue guidance.Also, the company registered year-over-year growth on both the counts, primarily stemming from growth across all four platforms. Also, higher-than-anticipated demand for its gaming chips helped drive the encouraging results. Furthermore, the Zacks analyst thinks NVIDIA's innovative product pipeline and strength in gaming and high-end notebook GPUs keep it well positioned.Higher adoption of NVIDIA's Volta processors is also likely to act as a catalyst in the near term. Nevertheless, a recent development like suspension of test drives for all its driverless vehicles and likely sluggish demand from cryptocurrency miners leads to caution about its near-term performance.(You can read the full research report on NVIDIA here >>> ).Buy-ranked Danaher 's shares have gained +10.1% over the past six months, outperforming the Zacks Diversified Operations industry, which has declined -5.5% over the same period. Danaher's first-quarter 2018 adjusted earnings beat expectations by 6.5% and improved 16.5% year over year.The company's core revenue growth, margin expansion and earnings growth during the reported quarter came on the back of its operating culture DBS. The Zacks analyst is optimistic about the company's core revenue and earnings growth, on the back of improving order trends and rising healthcare spending. Its recent acquisitions - Pall and Cepheid - are proving to be strong profit churners, and will boost core revenues in the quarters ahead.This apart, the company's continuous introduction of products enables it to penetrate new markets and gain competitive edge in existing ones. However, sluggish economic conditions across some key operating regions and unfavorable currency translations pose as significant headwinds.(You can read the full research report on Danaher here >>> ).Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Automatic Data Processing and Altria.5 Medical Stocks to Buy NowZacks names 5 companies poised to ride a medical breakthrough that is targeting cures for leukemia, AIDS, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, and other conditions.New products in this field are already generating substantial revenue and even more wondrous treatments are in the pipeline.

Are Discerning Investors Interested in These Shares: Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) and Novartis AG (NYSE:NVS) ‰ÛÒ Concordia Review,"In the past few sessions, investors have started paying a little bit more attention to shares of Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA). In recent trading action, the stock had changed -0.43% settling in at $192.09.Equity markets can move in an instant, requiring investors to always stay on their toes. Most sudden stock spikes or drops require the attention of anyone who is keeping a keen eye on the shares. What may go somewhat undetected is the slow and steady rise or fall of a particular stock. Sometimes it can be difficult to decipher fact from fiction in the markets. Why is a company that consistently produces strong returns going down? Why are the underperforming company shares moving higher? While there may be no clear cut answers to the questions, professional investors work endlessly to make sense of equity market nuances.Based on recent analysis, Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) shares have been seen trading -1.35% off of the 50-day peak and 14.38% away from the 50-day bottom. In terms of the stock price in relation to its moving averages, company shares are 2.07% away from the 20-day moving average and 6.33% off of the 50-day average. If we take a longer approach, shares have been trading 20.59% away from the 200-day moving average.Occasionally investors may be looking to shift their stock strategy. Maybe one plan worked for a period of time, but now economic conditions have shifted and a change is required. Whatever the case, the primary goal is typically to maximize profits. Finding a winning investing strategy may not happen immediately. Navigating the sometimes murky economic waters can be a struggle. Staying afloat may depend on many factors, but doing homework and studying all the available information is essential.Over the last year, Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA)‰Ûªs stock has performed61.36%. For the last six months, the stock has performed 29.04%. From the start of the calendar year, shares have been 27.50%.

Mastercard Puts Altruistic Spin On 'Priceless' Campaign,"Twenty years after starting its Priceless campaign, Mastercard is switching it up and asking consumers to take action. On Thursday morning, the Purchase, New York-based company is debuting its ""Start Something Priceless"" campaign that pushes people around the globe to do something to improve the world, either on their own, or through a Mastercard donation program.""What we are trying to do, unlike before, is trying to take a more active role in generating a movement around Priceless,"" says Raja Rajamannar, chief marketing and communications officer at Mastercard. He notes that this is the third iteration of the campaign, developed with McCann; the first 16-year-old phase was around celebrating priceless moments in life, and the recent four years were spent enabling the campaign through various partnerships.Comedian Ellen DeGeneres will kick off the new effort with a tweet on Thursday. Mastercard intends to premiere a music video, in which a group of artists sing about the biases they've overcome, on Monday ahead of a week-long effort preceding the Grammy Awards on Jan. 28. Mastercard will air the film during the awards, which will be in New York. It will also host a Mastercard House in Manhattan for the week where Mastercard users can attend concerts and experiences.Rajamannar notes that the ""Start Something"" campaign has been in the works for about a year and that Mastercard first tested it on its 15,000 employees. Some staffers are using the platform to create a ""salsa"" challenge in support of curing ALS disease. Mastercard is also running global initiatives, like interactive billboards in Paris where consumers can donate a week of meals to hungry schoolchildren.In addition to the Grammys, Mastercard will run various programing around other large events throughout the year including the Rugby World Cup and Cannes Film Festival.While Rajamannar declined to specify how much the brand is spending on the new Priceless phase, he noted that it is on par with previous iterations if not more. In 2016, Mastercard spent nearly $811 million on marketing and advertising, 1 percent less than in 2015, according to company financials.~ ~ ~CORRECTION: An earlier version of this article >said Ellen DeGeneres would help promote the new Mastercard effort with a mention on her show.

interstate flight inconvenience insurance; purchase security, extended appliance warranty; 'price guarantee' cover; and even rental car excess cover of up to $5,500 when hiring in Australia.Airport lounge access: 2/5Altitude Black combo card holders are treated to four airport lounge visits each year, being two visits to American Express' own-brand airport lounges in Sydney or Melbourne, and two further visits to other lounges, which vary based on how you're earning your points.If you've opted-in for Altitude Qantas, you're eligible for two Qantas Club lounge visits each year, while if you've chosen Altitude Rewards instead, you can take out a complimentary Priority Pass membership with two lounge visits included in the plan, which can be redeemed at over 1,000 lounges around the world, including several locations in Australia.Westpac Altitude Black credit card combo: the verdictWith a total overall annual fee of $449, or $499 if earning Qantas Points, the Westpac Altitude Black card duo certainly isn't cheap, but nor is having a standalone American Express card in your wallet plus a premium Visa or Mastercard from a separate bank, when both cards carry annual fees.For example, having a Qantas AMEX Ultimate Card instead would set you back $450, giving you 1.5 Qantas Points per $1 spent on everyday purchases, and if you paired an ANZ Frequent Flyer Platinum Visa alongside to earn the same 0.75 Qantas Points per $1 spent as the Westpac Mastercard (at least, on the first $3,000 of monthly charges), you'd be up for a further $295, or $745 all up.That said, different cards have different features - that Ultimate Card includes a $450 Qantas Travel Credit every year to help offset the annual fee, for instance, but with no option of a linked backup card, which is where the Westpac Altitude Black Mastercard + AMEX combo has an advantage, even with both cards technically issued by separate banks.You can apply for the Westpac Altitude Black credit card combo here.","The American Express Westpac Altitude Black Card (issued by American Express Australia) is paired with the Westpac Altitude Black World Mastercard (issued by Westpac), giving Westpac customers the ability to earn more points in places where AMEX is accepted, while still earning some points everywhere else.With an deal of up to 120,000 bonus Qantas Points or 120,000 Altitude Points (worth 60,000 Virgin Australia Velocity points) for new customers.Just note: the Altitude Black Mastercard doesn't provide points on payments to the ATO, however, the American Express Westpac Altitude Black Card does offer points on ATO payments (and all other government charges) at a reduced rate.Inclusive travel insurance: 4.5/5You may be covered by complimentary travel insurance on journeys of six months or less after charging at least $500 of eligible travel costs to your Westpac Altitude Black Mastercard or your American Express Westpac Altitude Black Card before departing Australia.You can apply for the Westpac Altitude Black credit card combo here.","['card', 'altitude', 'westpac', 'airlines', 'qantas', 'australia', 'amex', 'black', 'combo', 'points', 'miles', 'mastercard']",,,[],,https://www.ausbt.com.au/westpac-altitude-black-amex-mastercard-combo,,,,

MasterCard Says Signatures No Longer Required at the Checkout Counter,"What‰Ûªs happening at the checkout counter is changing in a big hurry.Checks are basically extinct. Cash is almost gone. Credit cards are being replaced by phones. And even the cards are changing ‰ÛÓ though that‰Ûªs going slower than originally planned.Now, you can start saying good-bye to the signature ‰ÛÓ or what your customers call their signature.MasterCard Drops Signature RequirementMasterCard (NYSE:MA) just announced it‰Ûªs doing away with a policy where merchants must reuire signatures from customers at checkout counters. The action concerns all transactions in the U.S. and Canada.The phase-out will be complete by April 2018 but from the tone of the announcement, it seems the company is aware that customers signing off on a transaction has already become largely a thing of the past.‰ÛÏThink about the purchases you‰Ûªve made over the past week or month. How many of them required you to sign on the dotted line? In my case, I made three quick stops on the way into work this morning and didn‰Ûªt scribble my name for any of those purchases,‰Ûù writes MasterCard Executive Vice President of U.S. Market Development Linda Kirkpatrick on the company‰Ûªs Beyond the Transaction blog.For now, this change will only apply to MasterCard customers at your checkout counter. MasterCard says the policy shift is a response to its own customer demands. Company cardholders say they want to spend less time at the register.‰ÛÏThe change matches all of our expectations for fast and convenient shopping experiences. A majority of people believe it would be easier to pay and that checkout lines would move faster if they didn‰Ûªt need to sign when making a purchase,‰Ûù Kirkpatrick adds.It‰Ûªs hard to imagine not requiring customers to sign their names will significantly reduce the time they spend in your business‰Ûªs checkout line. But when you combine this change with all the other recent advancements happening at the register, the process has come a long way since requiring two forms of ID to accept a check or when you had to make a credit card imprint.MasterCard does point out one benefit to its merchants. Once signatures aren‰Ûªt required at checkout, it‰Ûªll spare your business the burden of safely storing and eventually disposing of those signatures.Kirkpatrick adds the change will not impact the security of any MasterCard transaction in the future. She writes, ‰ÛÏOur secure network and state-of-the art systems combined with new digital payment methods that include chip, tokenization, biometrics and specialized digital platforms use newer and more secure methods to prove identity.‰Ûù","MasterCard Drops Signature RequirementMasterCard (NYSE:MA) just announced it‰Ûªs doing away with a policy where merchants must reuire signatures from customers at checkout counters.For now, this change will only apply to MasterCard customers at your checkout counter.It‰Ûªs hard to imagine not requiring customers to sign their names will significantly reduce the time they spend in your business‰Ûªs checkout line.Once signatures aren‰Ûªt required at checkout, it‰Ûªll spare your business the burden of safely storing and eventually disposing of those signatures.Kirkpatrick adds the change will not impact the security of any MasterCard transaction in the future.","['change', 'checkout', 'writes', 'transaction', 'mastercard', 'customers', 'sign', 'longer', 'counter', 'spend', 'signatures', 'required', 'way']",,,[],2017-10-22 15:00:22-04:00,https://smallbiztrends.com/2017/10/mastercard-drops-signature-requirement.html,,,,
Mastercard announces new collaboration with Zapper,"Mastercard to announce new collaboration with ZapperShareZapper will soon be compatible with Mastercard‰Ûªs Masterpass payments system, after the companies on Monday announced a new possible collaboration.The two companies are currently in talks to use the QR-code fueled app to complete payments at Masterpass-enabled merchants across South Africa, while Masterpass users can similarly use Zapper to complete payments where applicable.Mechanically, nothing will change for those who have used Zapper in the past.‰ÛÏWhen shopping, Masterpass users simply scan a Zapper QR code displayed at a point of sale, or online at a wide range of Zapper merchants, to pay for goods and services,‰Ûù the companies explained in a press release.Once the code is scanned, users will be asked to enter their payment amount, which will then be confirmed through either the users‰Ûª ATM PIN or a one-time PIN number sent to their smartphone.‰ÛÏEvery transaction processed through Masterpass is authorised by the cardholder, ensuring that customers are always in control and have high levels of security for the transaction,‰Ûù they continued.The collaboration will give Zapper a merchant pool approaching 70 000 countrywide, while partnering with Zapper gives Masterpass users a QR code scanning service for payments.Editor‰Ûªs note: a previous release by both companies suggested that a collaboration deal has in fact been completed, however the companies have told Memeburn that they are still engaging in negotiations.

Mastercard Develops Remote Fingerprint Scanning for Biometric Credit Cards,"Earlier this week, Mastercard unveiled a new biometric card sleeve that allows users to register their fingerprints without visiting a bank branch. The sleeve scans the fingerprint through a battery-powered sensor, and then the fingerprint is permanently linked to the digital encryption on the card.Mastercard is moving away from card security based on ‰ÛÏwhat people know.‰Ûù The company believes that forgetting a PIN or password should not prevent someone from using a card. Biometric technology, like fingerprint or iris scanning, turns the focus to physical attributes that are unique to each individual.To complete the registration, Mastercard will send an enrollment kit in the mail separate from the biometric credit card. Mastercard hopes that this will ‰ÛÏhelp speed adoption of biometrics by issuers and consumers alike.‰Ûù The at-home approach also reduces the need for branch-based support, which lowers the company‰Ûªs overhead costs.The self-enrollment sleeve was developed by IDEX, a technology company based in Norway. It uses a large area sensor, so the fingers do not have to be in a perfect placement to register the fingerprints. IDEX says the registration can take place without a computer, smartphone, or internet connection. Everything happens directly on the card.","Earlier this week, Mastercard unveiled a new biometric card sleeve that allows users to register their fingerprints without visiting a bank branch.The sleeve scans the fingerprint through a battery-powered sensor, and then the fingerprint is permanently linked to the digital encryption on the card.Biometric technology, like fingerprint or iris scanning, turns the focus to physical attributes that are unique to each individual.To complete the registration, Mastercard will send an enrollment kit in the mail separate from the biometric credit card.The self-enrollment sleeve was developed by IDEX, a technology company based in Norway.","['develops', 'card', 'biometric', 'sleeve', 'credit', 'register', 'idex', 'scanning', 'remote', 'technology', 'sensor', 'cards', 'registration', 'fingerprint', 'mastercard']",,,[],5/3/18 0:00,https://www.lowcards.com/mastercard-develops-remote-fingerprint-scanning-for-biometric-cards-54897,,,,

"Mastercard, IFC Expand Digital Payments Deal","Mastercard and IFC, a member of the World Bank Group, announced Thursday (April 26) that they have updated a $250 million global risk-sharing facility in an effort to expand access to electronic payments in emerging markets.In a press release, Mastercard said that updating the agreement inked in 2015 will help financial companies in developing countries participate in the Mastercard network through an IFC program. IFC will guarantee up to 100 percent of the settlement risk. Mastercard said the new agreement will support a ‰ÛÏmajor‰Ûù expansion of the program to more participating banks and financial institutions.According to Mastercard electronic payments help underserved consumers and small businesses participate in the formal economy. Still, many financial institutions in emerging market have difficulty covering the transaction settlement obligations which makes it harder for financial services to scale in a quick manner in emerging markets. ‰ÛÏThis partnership will help bring modern financial services to underserved people around the world. It allows us to pool our capabilities in risk management and financial technologies, and to leverage our global network of financial institutions to deliver financial inclusion,‰Ûù said Stephanie Von Friedeburg, IFC Chief Operating Officer.Mastercard said with the revised agreement it will expand its efforts to identify, develop and implement programs with participating financial institutions, improving access to electronic payments for millions of people in emerging markets. Mastercard said it will also continue to support a separate 2016 agreement with IFC to increase acceptance of electronic payments among small businesses and micro-entrepreneurs in the same markets. ‰ÛÏTrue inclusion is not something any one entity can deliver on its own,‰Ûù said Michael Froman, Vice Chairman and President of Strategic Growth at Mastercard in the same press release. ‰ÛÏIt‰Ûªs partnerships like this, combined with technology and know-how, that are truly driving greater inclusion in emerging markets. The programs the facility is developing around the world are vital to bringing people and communities into the financial system and on a path to prosperity.‰ÛùMastercard said its work with the World Bank Group is helping to increase universal financial access by 2020. Back in 2015, it committed to reaching 500 million people previously excluded from financial services within a five-year time frame.

Mastercard Memorial Cup: A player to watch on each of the four teams,"The field is set for the 100th Mastercard Memorial Cup in Regina. The host Regina Pats will welcome the Hamilton Bulldogs (OHL), Acadie-Bathurst Titan (QMJHL) and the Swift Current Broncos (WHL) beginning Friday night, when the hometown team takes on Hamilton.Acadie-Bathurst returns to the big dance for the first time since 1999. Three years ago, Hamilton relocated from Belleville and the junior-hockey starved city last appeared in and won the Cup in 1976 as the Fincups. It‰Ûªs been 25 years since Swift Current appeared in the Memorial Cup. Regina has four Memorial Cup titles, but their last win came in 1974.As four teams with lengthy droughts get ready to contest the toughest trophy to win in sports, we give you a player to watch on each one:Acadie-Bathurst Titan, Jeffrey Truchon-Viel: The captain of the Titan plays a hard-nosed, no-nonsense style of game. He was one of only four CHL players to score 30-plus goals and amass 100-plus PIM. Seventeen of his 23 points came at even strength and of his 14 playoff markers, five were game-winners and two were series clinchers. The undrafted San Jose free agent signee played a smart, physical game in the President Cup final, where he got just eight PIMs while putting up five points. For his efforts, Truchon-Viel was named the 2018 Guy Lafleur Trophy winner as the QMJHL‰Ûªs playoff MVP.Regina Pats, Sam Steel: Individually, Steel has done just about everything a junior-aged player can. He was the 2016-17 WHL Player of the Year after leading all CHLers with 131 points. He‰Ûªs a first round pick of Anaheim, he‰Ûªs won gold with Canada at the world juniors and he‰Ûªs played in a league championship. Steel is the centrepiece of Regina‰Ûªs offence and put up 11 points in their first-round series loss to Swift Current, but scored only once. He has a high hockey IQ and plays a 200-foot game. With 45 days off since Regina‰Ûªs last game, it will be up to Steel to keep his team on point, especially on opening night when the Pats host OHL champion Hamilton. There‰Ûªs no one in the CHL more dedicated to his craft, so after a busy two years, the layoff should place Steel in great standing to make the host team a legit threat.Hamilton Bulldogs, Robert Thomas: Arguably the CHL‰Ûªs most-rounded and NHL-ready player, Thomas gave the Bulldogs game-changing ability after he was acquired from London. It took a while for the St. Louis first-rounder to adjust to fewer minutes and less power play time, but after he bought into coach John Gruden‰Ûªs philosophy, the Bulldogs became a different team. Thomas takes all of Hamilton‰Ûªs important faceoffs, he brings Mastercard Memorial Cup experience and he can impact the game in a variety of ways that don‰Ûªt always involve putting up points. Further, he‰Ûªs been able to take over the Hamilton room without disrespecting the previous leadership group. Along with those intangibles, he brings London swagger, an always-appreciated asset at this time of year.Swift Current Broncos, Stuart Skinner: The goalie endured two seven-game and one six-game series in the 2017 playoffs and that experience made him a target for Swift Current when they made a blockbuster deal with Lethbridge at the WHL‰Ûªs trade deadline this year. The 6-foot-4 netminder put up the best numbers of his career down the stretch with the Broncos (16-6-1-1, 2.68 GAA, .914 SP). He could‰Ûªve easily been named WHL playoff MVP as he played all but 46 minutes of Swift Current‰Ûªs historic championship run; the Edmonton Oilers third-rounder went 16-8-2 with a 2.20 GAA and .932 SP with an amazing six playoff shutouts, including a 31-save blanking in the championship clincher over Everett. The Oilers did him a favour by waiting until the Ed Chynoweth Cup was over before inking him to an entry-level deal Monday.","The field is set for the 100th Mastercard Memorial Cup in Regina.It‰Ûªs been 25 years since Swift Current appeared in the Memorial Cup.Regina has four Memorial Cup titles, but their last win came in 1974.Thomas takes all of Hamilton‰Ûªs important faceoffs, he brings Mastercard Memorial Cup experience and he can impact the game in a variety of ways that don‰Ûªt always involve putting up points.Swift Current Broncos, Stuart Skinner: The goalie endured two seven-game and one six-game series in the 2017 playoffs and that experience made him a target for Swift Current when they made a blockbuster deal with Lethbridge at the WHL‰Ûªs trade deadline this year.","['cup', 'current', 'player', 'mastercard', 'teams', 'playoff', 'swift', 'points', 'steel', 'watch', 'team', 'memorial', 'game']",,,"['Rogers Digital Media', 'Sam Cosentino', 'Canadian Press']",,https://www.sportsnet.ca/hockey/juniors/mastercard-memorial-cup-player-watch-four-teams/,,,,
Amazon Pays Merchants To Use Amazon Pay,"Amazon is offering discounts to merchants who use its online payments service.According to Bloomberg, online merchants using Amazon‰Ûªs service have paid about 2.9 percent of each credit card transaction plus 30 cents, which is shared among Amazon, card issuers and payment networks.Now the eCommerce giant is offering to negotiate lower fees with select merchants who make long-term commitments to use Amazon Pay.An Amazon spokeswoman declined to comment, and it is unknown how many retailers have received the offer for discounts. Still, the news caused shares of PayPal to drop 4.1 percent on Wednesday (May 2), while Square lost most of its 3.7 percent gain from earlier in the day. Visa fell 0.9 percent.In an interview with PYMNTS‰Ûª Karen Webster, Patrick Gauthier, Amazon‰Ûªs VP of external payments, said that 33 million consumers from 170 countries are using Amazon Pay. Roughly half of those customers are members of Amazon‰Ûªs coveted customer base: Amazon Prime. Nearly a third of the transactions made by those customers were done via a mobile device, with an average transaction size of $80.The service allows online shoppers to log into their Amazon accounts from other websites, so they can complete the transaction using stored credit cards and delivery addresses rather than having to enter them again. Customers include Gogo Inc., which provides in-flight internet access.Some merchants, however, have been reluctant to share information with the company out of fear that Amazon could compete with them later by selling similar items on its site.The discount move is proof that Amazon is thinking less about profitability right now and more about spreading its use. That says a lot, since swipe fees are a $90 billion annual business, with lenders such as JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc., networks including Visa Inc. and Mastercard Inc., and payment processors like First Data Corp. and Stripe Inc. earning a fraction of every sale when shoppers complete a transaction.","Amazon is offering discounts to merchants who use its online payments service.According to Bloomberg, online merchants using Amazon‰Ûªs service have paid about 2.9 percent of each credit card transaction plus 30 cents, which is shared among Amazon, card issuers and payment networks.Now the eCommerce giant is offering to negotiate lower fees with select merchants who make long-term commitments to use Amazon Pay.In an interview with PYMNTS‰Ûª Karen Webster, Patrick Gauthier, Amazon‰Ûªs VP of external payments, said that 33 million consumers from 170 countries are using Amazon Pay.The discount move is proof that Amazon is thinking less about profitability right now and more about spreading its use.","['visa', 'shoppers', 'transaction', 'amazon', 'pay', 'customers', 'service', 'using', 'online', 'merchants', 'pays', 'amazons']",,,[],2018-05-03 07:10:14+00:00,https://www.pymnts.com/amazon/2018/amazon-to-offer-merchants-discounts-for-using-amazon-pay/,,,,
Mastercard CFO: Lack of Crypto Wallet Funding Is Partly Why Cross-Border Transaction Growth Is In Decline,"Quarterly cross-border transaction growth for Mastercard declined by 2% over the last year partly due to the lack of customers using the service to purchase cryptocurrencies, according to Mastercard‰Ûªs CFO.During the May earnings call, Mastercard‰Ûªs CFO Martina Hund-Mejean revealed that quarterly cross-border transaction growth for the company is down by 2% from the first quarter.Hund-Mejean has attributed this lack of cross-border payment growth to drop in crypto-wallet funding. The Mastercard CFO highlighted the role of cryptocurrencies in the growth slowdown in a recent earnings call:‰ÛÏThis is due to the recent drop-off in crypto wallet funding. We expect cross-border growth to moderate somewhat.‰ÛùA number of banks across America, including JP Morgan and Bank of America, have recently moved to ban credit card transactions to cryptocurrencies. This ban has, in turn, caused a domino effect with smaller banks like Capital One and Citigroup following their lead, potentially contributing to the decline in crypto wallet funding transactions.Mastercard Stock Maintains Steady ClimbDespite this slight dip in growth, Mastercard stock continues to climb with a 3% gain after the reported profits beat Wall Street expectations with price trading at $186.48.While the short-term effect caused by the lack of crypto purchasing through the platform has marginally decreased cross-border transaction growth, cryptocurrency based card vendors are primed to assist the payment platform in establishing a strong presence in the cryptocurrency sector ‰ÛÓ should Mastercard choose to support it.While such integration would provide greater usability for cryptocurrencies in allowing users to transact with any preexisting merchants, Mastercard appears to have no interest in taking part in this level of the financial sector.During the earnings call Mastercard CEO Ajay Banga illustrated his concerns about the erratic nature of the crypto market stating:‰ÛÏThis is not something we count on because we just don‰Ûªt know how to predict it or we don‰Ûªt even want to count it.‰ÛùMastercard cryptocurrency debit cards are not a new concept ‰ÛÓ companies such as Wirex, CoinsBank and Wagecan current support Mastercard transactions with varying fee structures. However, this segment of cryptocurrency market has been anything but stable.Shifting Policy Causes Investors to Seek Other ChannelsThis unexpected turn of events has eroded the market‰Ûªs trust in such platforms toprovide reliable and consistent service until further financial frameworks are established.Additionally, the recent growth of Bitcoin-enabled ATMs and point of sales have brought into question the place of such systems within the economic framework, as most charge excess fees to access the Mastercard network.As cryptocurrencies continue to grow, consumer gateways will continue to be an invaluable asset to enable investors to conduct daily transactions with fiat merchants.Whether this occurs through widespread adoption of crypto-powered point of sale systems or the implementation of crypto-enabled payment gateways such as Mastercard depends heavily on whether these financial services decide to embrace cryptocurrencies moving forward.Cover Photo by Mike Kononov on UnsplashDisclaimer: Our writers' opinions are solely their own and do not reflect the opinion of CryptoSlate.

CreditShop Introduces the Mercury Mastercard for Hardworking Americans,"Mercury MastercardCreditShop LLC, a finance company focused on developing, marketing and servicing consumer-friendly credit products, today announced the introduction of the Mercury Mastercard. Mercury cards will provide cardmembers with complementary access to their FICO score, and account performance will be reported to major credit bureaus.

3 Reasons for Mastercard Investors to Cheer,"Mastercard Inc's (NYSE:MA) business continues to hum: When the company recently reported its third-quarter earnings, there was a lot for investors to like. Net revenue rose to $3.4 billion, an 18% increase year over year, while earnings per share were up to $1.34, an even more robust 24% increase year over year. The revenue and earnings growth were driven by increases in gross dollar volume and switched transaction counts, up 10% and 17%, respectively, from 2016's third quarter. The market reacted to the news only mildly, probably because Mastercard shares have already had an incredible run-up this year. As I write, shares are up more than 44% year to date and almost 15% since the start of August.After reading through the company's conference call transcript provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence, here are three more catalysts shareholders in the global payments network can look forward to in the quarters and years ahead.1. Other Revenues show strong growth againIn its quarterly earnings presentations, Mastercard breaks out its cross-border fees, domestic assessments, and transaction processing fees so that investors can see how much each contributes to the company's top line. These are essentially fees Mastercard collects as tolls on its vast payment network and are based on factors such as the number of transactions that occur across its network and dollar volume that passes through. Collectively, these streams of revenue accounted for about 85% of Mastercard's revenue for the quarter before rebates and incentives are backed out.The remaining 15% of revenue, which Mastercard descriptively calls ""Other Revenues,"" accounts for other services Mastercard provides its financial institution and merchant clients, such as reward-program management, data analytics, and fraud prevention. This quarter, Mastercard's Other Revenues once again showed strong growth, jumping to $747 million, a 21% increase year over year.Here's how Mastercard's Other Revenues' growth compares to the company's overall growth:Mastercard Metric Q3 2017 Q3 2016 Year-Over-Year Growth Net revenue $3.40 billion $2.88 billion 18% Diluted earnings per share $1.34 $1.08 24% Other Revenues $747 million $620 million 21% Gross dollar volume $1.35 trillion $1.22 trillion 10% Switched transactions 16.85 billion 14.45 billion 17%One of the areas in which Mastercard has put in the most work in this space is real-time fraud detection. During the company's conference call, Mastercard CEO Ajay Banga talked about the company's new flagship security platform, Safety Net:In the past, we've talked about and shown you Safety Net, which identifies large-scale fraud attacks and blocks transactions in realtime, trying therefore to save our customers from significant losses. This quarter, we added to our toolsets with what we call the early detection system, which alerts issuers to accounts that are at risk of future fraudulent activities, even before they have been used in an unauthorized transaction. Like Safety Net and all our fraud products and services, this predictive tool leverages the power of the Mastercard network to supplement issuers' own fraud defenses. But early detection system also combines external data and insights to generate confidence levels to help our customers determine the appropriate action to take ...The more Mastercard can offer merchants and financial institutions these types of services, the more the company will be able to earn in this growing revenue category.2. New dealsBesides boosting the company's top line, a major benefit of the company's supplemental services, which complement its core payment network, is that they are helping the company win new deals from banks. When highlighting new deals in the company's second-quarter conference call, Banga said, ""Our innovative solutions and value-added services were key differentiators for us."" This quarter didn't disappoint and brought more new deals to investors' attention.Of course, the biggest win of the quarter was announced a few weeks earlier, at Mastercard's Investor Day: The company said it had won Bank of America's cash rewards and non-rewards credit card portfolio. Craig Vosburg, Mastercard's president of North America operations, said of the deal, ""This win adds to our growing partnership with Bank of America, which covers all of their payments business lines.""In the conference call following the quarterly release, Banga added that Mastercard has secured new deals with the National Commercial Bank, one of Saudi Arabia's largest banks, as well as with the Banque Travelex in France, and will be Costco Wholesale's exclusive co-brand partner in Japan starting in early 2018.3. The place to be is B2BEarlier this summer, Mastercard launched its B2B Hub, a platform the company envisions will allow smaller and medium-sized businesses to digitize all of their payments, not just card payments. Mastercard CFO Martina Hund-Mejean estimated the global B2B payments market to be about $124 trillion, of which ""only"" $20 trillion is facilitated at the point of sale. The rest is negotiated via other means, like cash, checks, or ACH (Automatic Clearing House, a vast electronic payments network commonly used for transactions like direct deposit and payroll). The company believes this platform will appeal to businesses as a way to simplify their accounts payable processes.This quarter, Mastercard announced its first B2B Hub customer, Fifth Third Bancorp. Moreover, the company announced it was specifically researching, experimenting, and investing in blockchain technology because it strongly believes there are more applications for blockchain in this space than with consumer-facing payments. Banga said:So we've signed a number of patents in the space in our own blockchain and our own platform. We have developed APIs, and we've also done things like making investments ... which enable us to look at the way other people are innovating using their blockchains ... But the idea is that we will open this up to financial institutional merchants, so they can connect into our settlement network ... The initial focus is on the B2B space because we continue to believe that the challenges of speed, of transparency and costs, both in domestic and cross-border payments in B2B, are more interesting than trying to find technology looking for a problem to solve in consumer payments that consumers do not perceive.For shareholders, it is good to see Mastercard looking at every new emergent technology to gain an advantage in such a potentially huge new market for the company.Mastercard's stock is already up a great deal in 2017 and now sports a P/E ratio of almost 35; that is certainly a high price for such a mature company. But I believe the company is worthy of such a high valuation. Mastercard still has a long runway of growth ahead as digital and electronic payments become more and more common around the world. What makes Mastercard even more appealing to investors is the fact is that it is currently offering services that boost the top line and is securing new deals while exploring massive opportunities in the B2B-payments arena. With these catalysts in place, Mastercard investors should be looking at market-beating returns for a long time to come.","Mastercard Inc's (NYSE:MA) business continues to hum: When the company recently reported its third-quarter earnings, there was a lot for investors to like.The remaining 15% of revenue, which Mastercard descriptively calls ""Other Revenues,"" accounts for other services Mastercard provides its financial institution and merchant clients, such as reward-program management, data analytics, and fraud prevention.Like Safety Net and all our fraud products and services, this predictive tool leverages the power of the Mastercard network to supplement issuers' own fraud defenses.This quarter, Mastercard announced its first B2B Hub customer, Fifth Third Bancorp.With these catalysts in place, Mastercard investors should be looking at market-beating returns for a long time to come.","['cheer', 'investors', 'companys', 'services', 'payments', 'revenues', 'company', 'quarter', 'network', 'growth', 'revenue', 'mastercard', 'reasons']",,,"['Matthew Cochrane', 'As An Economic Crimes Detective', 'Matthew Focuses On Helping Others Becoming Victims Of Fraud', 'Scams.

National Bank of Kuwait Launches Biometric Mastercard Project,"In cooperation with Mastercard, the National Bank of Kuwait will lead the first biometric payment card trial in the GCC, an economic bloc that also includes Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Bahrain, and Oman.The news comes amid a flurry of activity concerning biometric payment card pilots in the region. In the middle of April, Gemalto announced that Lebanon-based FinTech specialist Areeba would offer its biometric Visa card to its client network, and shortly after that fingerprint sensor specialist Fingerprint Cards announced its sensors were being used in an unnamed Visa-led biometric cards project ‰ÛÒ presumably the same one. This week, fingerprint biometrics specialist IDEX announced that a trial of its own biometric card technology was getting underway in the Middle East, offering few further details on the project; but given that Mastercard is the firm‰Ûªs major payments partner, it could concern this new initiative with the National Bank of Kuwait.In a statement, NBK explained that the biometric card ‰ÛÏworks like any other chip card,‰Ûù as ‰ÛÏ[t]he cardholder simply dips the card into a retailer‰Ûªs point-of-sale terminal while placing their finger on the embedded sensor.‰Ûù That suggests it will be a contact-based solution, rather than one based on contactless technology, though by eliminating the use of PINs it should prove to be more convenient than standard contact-based EMV transactions.Meanwhile, NBK also announced that it will be the first bank in the Middle East and Africa region to offer its customers Identity Check, Mastercard‰Ûªs biometric authentication platform. The system will be available as an app from Google Play or Apple‰Ûªs App Store, and will allow NBK customers to use their fingerprint or facial biometrics via their smartphones to confirm online purchases.‰ÛÒMay 17, 2018 ‰ÛÒ by Alex Perala","In cooperation with Mastercard, the National Bank of Kuwait will lead the first biometric payment card trial in the GCC, an economic bloc that also includes Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Bahrain, and Oman.The news comes amid a flurry of activity concerning biometric payment card pilots in the region.In the middle of April, Gemalto announced that Lebanon-based FinTech specialist Areeba would offer its biometric Visa card to its client network, and shortly after that fingerprint sensor specialist Fingerprint Cards announced its sensors were being used in an unnamed Visa-led biometric cards project ‰ÛÒ presumably the same one.This week, fingerprint biometrics specialist IDEX announced that a trial of its own biometric card technology was getting underway in the Middle East, offering few further details on the project; but given that Mastercard is the firm‰Ûªs major payments partner, it could concern this new initiative with the National Bank of Kuwait.Meanwhile, NBK also announced that it will be the first bank in the Middle East and Africa region to offer its customers Identity Check, Mastercard‰Ûªs biometric authentication platform.","['card', 'biometric', 'middle', 'specialist', 'project', 'announced', 'technology', 'kuwait', 'national', 'launches', 'bank', 'trial', 'fingerprint', 'mastercard', 'nbk']",,,[],2018-05-17 10:45:25-04:00,https://findbiometrics.com/national-bank-kuwait-launches-biometric-mastercard-project-505172/,,,,
Mastercard Start Path Class of 2018 Underway,"When Mastercard launched the Start Path accelerator program in 2014, the goal ‰ÛÒ according to VP and senior business leader, Amy Neale ‰ÛÒ was to make it easier for emerging companies to enter ‰ÛÏour world‰Ûù through a combination of operational support, commercial access and some strategic funding.‰ÛÏAnd when we talk about our world, we mean not just payments, but FinTech more broadly ‰ÛÒ and, even more broadly than that, commerce,‰Ûù she said.In many ways, according to Neale, it was a traditional corporate accelerator model at launch. Over time, however, that view has strategically shifted in a series of small but critical ways, as Mastercard has learned more about the start-up world and the types of firms with which they are best suited to partner.For example, over the last two years, Mastercard has moved its focus from start-ups that are still quite nascent, to those that have taken important steps to grow by raising funds, putting an actual product in market and beginning to scale.‰ÛÏWhat we recognized was that for a company like Mastercard and our partners, it is the companies that have been able to demonstrate some traction, build out the product and validate it to the customer that we are really able to work with,‰Ûù noted Neale. ‰ÛÏAnd our goal is to find the opportunities to work together with start-up companies.‰ÛùThose slightly later-stage companies proved to be the best fit for that goal. Plus, Neale noted, while they were meeting and reviewing companies, it quickly became apparent that later-stage early start-ups were experiencing something of a gap in the marketplace. These firms had a solid proof of concept, but needed an opportunity to scale their tech. As Neale pointed out, this particularly applied to international firms, which may be well-known in their home market but would like to expand globally. Mastercard, given its global nature, is well-positioned to help those expansions happen.And so, as 2018 begins, so does the Start Path class of 2018, which is accepting applications until Jan. 15.The Start Path Admissions ProcessThe process for startups is as straightforward as completing a very simple form online and, if the company wishes, submitting a reference.‰ÛÏWe ask a few basic but important questions,‰Ûù Neale said. ‰ÛÏWe want to know a little about their business ‰ÛÒ what funding they‰Ûªve managed to pick up, what problem they are trying to solve, what types of products they‰Ûªve built.‰ÛùFrom there, applications are screened and a shortlist of applicants is invited to come and pitch directly to Mastercard. After meeting with senior personnel, Mastercard creates the class with an eye toward assembling a diverse cohort of businesses.Over the last four years, Neale noted, Mastercard has evaluated over 5,000 firms through the Start Path program, and has chosen only 150 to participate.Last year, Start Path evaluated roughly 1,500 companies and welcomed 22 to join the program in three separate waves. The class of 2017 included firms working on projects as varied as finding new ways to use blockchain, protect digital identity, digitize donations, manage health care data, create omnichannel retail solutions and develop artificial intelligence innovations to enhance consumer engagement.Efforts to mentor and develop those programs have borne fruit.In 2017 alone, Neale noted, Mastercard had roughly 30 separate collaborative projects they were able to ‰ÛÏstand up‰Ûù with startup companies, experiencing what she described as the ‰ÛÏholy grail‰Ûù of start-up collaborations: moving from the theoretical conversations to actual work that has an impact on people‰Ûªs lives and businesses.As a new year is getting up and running, Neale said that Mastercard is excited to get their next wave of start-ups, and to build the next generation of solutions.‰ÛÏWe are looking for solutions that create better experiences for consumers in all aspects of commerce interactions,‰Ûù Neale emphasized. ‰ÛÏWhether that is from an SMB‰Ûªs point of view or a new experience for millennials getting their feet wet with financial services for the first time or emerging tech that is being deployed in a way to create new experiences, we are trying to be as broad as possible in our thinking.‰ÛùApplicants have until Jan. 15 to apply.","And so, as 2018 begins, so does the Start Path class of 2018, which is accepting applications until Jan. 15.The Start Path Admissions ProcessThe process for startups is as straightforward as completing a very simple form online and, if the company wishes, submitting a reference.After meeting with senior personnel, Mastercard creates the class with an eye toward assembling a diverse cohort of businesses.Over the last four years, Neale noted, Mastercard has evaluated over 5,000 firms through the Start Path program, and has chosen only 150 to participate.Last year, Start Path evaluated roughly 1,500 companies and welcomed 22 to join the program in three separate waves.","['underway', 'mastercard', '2018', 'companies', 'neale', 'world', 'class', 'start', 'firms', 'startups', 'path', 'startup', 'noted']",,,[],2018-01-10 04:00:00+00:00,https://www.pymnts.com/mastercard/2018/start-path-mastercard-startups-omnichannel/,,,,
Mastercard Recognises the Influence of Cryptocurrencies,"Mastercard released their 2018 Q1 financial results on May 2 showing record first-quarter net income of $1.5 billion and revenue of $3.6 billion. They attributed some of this success to the December and January boom in cryptocurrency prices as they expect results to drop following the recent bear market.Mastercard Acknowledge Cryptocurrency InfluenceCross-border volumes increased 21% in quarter one compared to the previous year which is more than the 17% increase for the fourth-quarter 2017. However, if the month of April is included, the increase in volume is down by 2%. Mastercard CFO Martina Hund-Mejean attributes this recent dip to a reduction in the number of people buying cryptocurrencies.Hund-Mejean said: ‰ÛÏWe expect cross-border growth to moderate somewhat. This is due to the recent drop-off in crypto wallet funding.‰ÛÏWhat the issue is that a number of the banks have decided, in particular in the United States, that they would not allow the usage of cards for this particular funding vehicle. And that‰Ûªs why we have already seen a relatively significant decrease of the volume related to that event.‰ÛùCard companies have cracked down on buying cryptocurrencies as they fear that individuals will not be able to pay off the debts they may accrue. In February, NewsBTC reported on U.K. bank Lloyds banning cryptocurrency purchases from credit cards. On the other hand, Barclays announced they were allowing Coinbase to open a bank account and have since set-up a venture capital unit focused on new technology such as blockchain.Mastercard president and CEO Ajay Banga said: ‰ÛÏThe governments around the world ‰ÛÒ I was out in Asia recently. And Korea, for example, has pulled back on allowing some of these exchanges as well to operate. There‰Ûªs a lot of concerns even in Japan because one of their biggest exchanges got hacked into and has now been bought out by another company in an effort to bring that back to an even keel.‰ÛùIn January, Japanese exchange Coincheck was hacked for $534 million, resulting in the Japanese FSA raiding their offices. However, Coincheck did complete refunds to those affected totaling $430 million. Hacks on cryptocurrency exchanges have damaged confidence in the market as a two-year bear market followed the infamous Mt. Gox hack in 2014.Although Mastercard criticise the recent bear market for a dip in cross-border transactions, some individuals have been using the low prices to grow their holdings. Chinese investor Cai Wenshang reportedly told Sina that he has achieved his aim of owning 10,000 Bitcoin by buying over the last few months. During the first-quarter of 2018, the price of Bitcoin dropped as low as $6,000 and has since rebounded to $9,680.Mastercard emphasised their relationship with Santander, a bank which has expanded into the cryptocurrency market by releasing their app One Pay FX which uses Ripple technology.Banga said: ‰ÛÏIn Europe we continue to gain share in key markets and I‰Ûªm very pleased to say we‰Ûªre expanding our relationship with the Santander Group. In the U.K., Santander will issue Mastercard debit cards for its more than nine million consumer and commercial bank accounts, making this our largest debit slip in the U.K. to date.Featured image from Shutterstock.","Mastercard Acknowledge Cryptocurrency InfluenceCross-border volumes increased 21% in quarter one compared to the previous year which is more than the 17% increase for the fourth-quarter 2017.Mastercard CFO Martina Hund-Mejean attributes this recent dip to a reduction in the number of people buying cryptocurrencies.Hacks on cryptocurrency exchanges have damaged confidence in the market as a two-year bear market followed the infamous Mt.Although Mastercard criticise the recent bear market for a dip in cross-border transactions, some individuals have been using the low prices to grow their holdings.Mastercard emphasised their relationship with Santander, a bank which has expanded into the cryptocurrency market by releasing their app One Pay FX which uses Ripple technology.","['cryptocurrency', 'market', 'million', 'santander', 'influence', 'recognises', 'uk', 'recent', 'exchanges', 'cards', 'bank', 'cryptocurrencies', 'mastercard']",,,"['Rick D.', 'Tim Copeland', 'Joseph Young', 'Thomas Delahunty', 'John Mcmahon', 'Rich Milly']",5/4/18 0:00,https://www.newsbtc.com/2018/05/04/mastercard-recognises-the-influence-of-cryptocurrencies/,,,,
IDEX Tech Allows For Remote Enrollment on Biometric Mastercard,"Today, Mastercard unveiled a key component in its biometric payment card solution: remote enrollment. Developed in collaboration with fingerprint biometric smart card specialist IDEX ‰ÛÒ which announced a self-service enrollment technology in late 2017 ‰ÛÓ the solution allows end users of next generation biometric payment cards to register their fingerprint data on their credit card from their own homes.Remote enrollment is a crucial factor for the mass adoption of biometric credit cards, ensuring a user can activate the card without having to visit a physical bank branch. The distribution model for the cards will therefore not require any infrastructure changes to deliver biometrics to Mastercard customers.‰ÛÏIssuers and consumers are increasingly demanding biometric cards, and to successfully deploy this in volume there is a need for mass enrolment,‰Ûù said Stan Swearingen, CEO, IDEX.Furthermore, remote enrollment on biometric cards is in the spirit of convenience and security that is largely responsible for the mass adoption of biometrics in consumer-facing finance at large.‰ÛÏPeople love the security our biometric card delivers because we put their needs first,‰Ûù said Bob Reany, EVP of Identity Solutions, Mastercard. ‰ÛÏThe card draws power from the payment terminal so it can be used anywhere, we use a flexible biometric scanner so it‰Ûªs more durable, and now we have a sleeve to register fingerprints so people don‰Ûªt have to make a trip to a bank branch.‰ÛùBiometric payment cards are widely seen as the next mass market for fingerprint sensors. Mastercard was the first company to pilot the technology in spring of 2017, and since then the fingerprint biometrics market has become fiercely competitive as the race for commercially released fingerprint smart cards heated up in the months following.For its part, IDEX made a strong pivot in its business model earlier this year, announcing that its primary focus as a fingerprint biometrics provider will be the smart cards market. With the implementation of its remote enrollment solution by one of the world‰Ûªs largest and most visible financial institutions, it‰Ûªs fair to say that strategy is paying off.‰ÛÓMay 1, 2018 ‰ÛÒ by Peter B.

Why Mastercard Is Adding a Charitable Aspect to Its Long-Running ‰Û÷Priceless‰Ûª Campaign,"Mastercard has added a new wrinkle to its famed Priceless campaign, which has already spanned two decades. The company worked with its creative agency, McCann, for the last year to develop the addition to the campaign. Called ‰ÛÏStart Something Priceless,‰Ûù the new effort is meant to inspire people to do something they have always wanted to do‰ÛÓread more, exercise regularly‰ÛÓwhile also inspiring them to make a difference.‰ÛÏPriceless used to be about Priceless moments, observing them and celebrating them,‰Ûù explained Raja Rajamannar, chief marketing and communications officer at Mastercard. ‰ÛÏWhat we also looked at was that Priceless was mostly used as an advertising platform and we said that‰Ûªs probably shortchanging ourselves. Priceless should be infused into everything we do in marketing and everything we do as a company.‰ÛùMastercard works with charitable programs like the World Food Programme and Stand Up to Cancer as well as encouraging careers in STEM. The company is using ‰ÛÏStart Something Priceless‰Ûù to encourage people to commit to their passions as well as push to change the communities around them through doing good.Part of the push to make the Priceless campaign hit various touch points in people‰Ûªs lives is the changing advertising landscape, with more and more people using AdBlockers or streaming sites that don‰Ûªt have advertising. Rajamannar has been argued that storytelling is dead and that consumers are looking for experiences from brands. Now Rajamannar is looking to move past experiences and into a deeper connection with consumers.‰ÛÏIf you look at consumers, research has shown that more than 80 percent of the people believe that brands have the power to do something, change something, bring about a movement,‰Ûù said Rajamannar. ‰ÛÏMore than 80 percent plus also feel that the brand should be bold and stand for what it believes in, that‰Ûªs what makes it authentic to them. This was one inspiration for us. When you‰Ûªre doing a campaign you look at three pillars: How do you strengthen the brand, how do you drive the business and how do you establish a competitive differentiation? This campaign seems to be firing on all of these three cylinders very well.‰ÛùThe company will be using the properties it sponsors, like the upcoming Grammy Awards, to tout the new charitable aspect of its Priceless campaign.","Mastercard has added a new wrinkle to its famed Priceless campaign, which has already spanned two decades.The company worked with its creative agency, McCann, for the last year to develop the addition to the campaign.‰ÛÏPriceless used to be about Priceless moments, observing them and celebrating them,‰Ûù explained Raja Rajamannar, chief marketing and communications officer at Mastercard.The company is using ‰ÛÏStart Something Priceless‰Ûù to encourage people to commit to their passions as well as push to change the communities around them through doing good.This campaign seems to be firing on all of these three cylinders very well.‰ÛùThe company will be using the properties it sponsors, like the upcoming Grammy Awards, to tout the new charitable aspect of its Priceless campaign.","['adding', 'using', 'advertising', 'campaign', 'stand', 'charitable', 'rajamannar', 'thats', 'company', 'start', 'aspect', 'priceless', 'mastercard', 'longrunning', 'used']",,,[],,http://www.adweek.com/brand-marketing/why-mastercard-is-adding-a-charitable-aspect-to-its-long-running-priceless-campaign/,,,,
U.S. Bank Mobile Payment Expands to Mastercard Business Travel Cards,"MINNEAPOLIS & PURCHASE, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--The U.S. Bank Corporate Travel Card is expanding its mobile capabilities to Mastercard corporate card transactions. Clients whose business travel cards run on the Mastercard network can now pay for purchases via mobile devices. With this expansion, U.S. Bank now offers the convenience and security of mobile payments for all corporate travel cards issued in the United States.‰ÛÏOur clients who have adopted mobile commercial payments are responding with great enthusiasm to its use for business travel,‰Ûù said U.S. Bank Global Bankcard General Manager Jeff Rankin. ‰ÛÏAt the same time, the number of hotels, airlines and other merchants accepting contactless payments via mobile phones is climbing. By 2020, experts predict the volume of mobile payments will jump by 80 percent from 2015 levels1. These trends are making the on-the-road payment experience increasingly easier and more secure. We‰Ûªre delighted to partner with Mastercard to help advance that vision.‰ÛùMobile payments offer added layers of security by connecting transactions to both users and their devices with technology called tokenization. Tokenization is a safe way to send sensitive data by replacing the actual information, for example, a card account number, with a proxy, known as a token. The token is protected both in-transit and at-rest. This reduces opportunities for fraud because actual card numbers are not stored on the device or at the retailer.‰ÛÏConsumers expect to have multiple ways to pay including cards, phones and other mobile devices,‰Ûù said Ed Glassman, EVP of North America Account Management for Mastercard. ‰ÛÏIt makes sense to bring these same options to the world of commercial cards. Mastercard is pleased to join forces with U.S. Bank to make life a little easier and more secure for business travelers.‰ÛùCommercial customers of the bank are encouraged to contact their U.S. Bank commercial card relationship manager or account coordinator with questions about mobile corporate payments.To watch a short U.S. Bank video, ‰ÛÏPay as You Phone,‰Ûù click on this link.å©2018 U.S. BankAbout U.S. Bank (www.usbank.com)Minneapolis-based U.S. Bancorp (NYSE: USB), with $462 billion in assets as of December 31, 2017, is the parent company of U.S. Bank National Association, the fifth largest commercial bank in the United States.

Mastercard Uses Facebook Messenger to Help SMEs Go Digital,"KAMPALA, UGANDA- At Mobile World Congress , Mastercard has announced that it will use Facebook Messenger to provide technology to small businesses in Africa and Asia to drive affordable acceptance of electronic and mobile payments.Access to digital payments will help these businesses expand to new markets, and unlock financial services and products that enables them to grow their livelihoods.This Messenger experience will launch in Nigeria, where Mastercard will pilot a new Masterpass QR bot to help business owners‰Ûª move beyond cash transactions to accepting QR payments.Ecobank and Zenith Bank will support this inaugural program. The pilot in Nigeria is the beginning of a larger plan by the two companies to include more businesses into the digital economy.According to research done by The Fletcher School and Mastercard Center for Inclusive Growth, of the $301 billion of funds flow from consumers to businesses in Nigeria, 98 percent is still based on cash.‰ÛÏEvery business owner is looking for ways to increase sales and draw new customers into their stores. By offering QR-based digital payments, smaller retailers can achieve these goals and create greater customer stickiness with little to no investment beyond the phone they already have,‰Ûù said Jorn Lambert, Executive Vice President, Digital Channels and Regions, Mastercard.‰ÛÏMasterpass QR opens up new commerce channels for these merchants and enables them to create auditable transaction records. These advances open doors to other financial tools and products such as loans to drive added business growth.‰ÛùTo get started, businesses can send a request to the bot to enable QR payments, receive approval from the bank, set up an account and start accepting digital payments in a fast, simple and secure manner. Once the account set up process is complete, business owners can print and display the QR code in their stores or save the code on their phones. Customers can pay by either scanning the code from their smartphone or by entering the merchant ID associated with the QR code into their feature phone.‰ÛÏBrands and developers around the world are turning to messaging to connect with the 1.3 billion people who use Messenger each month,‰Ûù said Kahina Van Dyke, Director of Payments and Financial Services Partnerships at Facebook.‰ÛÏWe are pleased that Mastercard is developing a service on the Messenger Platform to help small merchants use messaging to manage their business and connect with their customers.‰ÛùLaunched in 2016, Masterpass QR provides people with any type of mobile phone the ability to safely accept and make in-person purchases without cash or a plastic card. It provides greater choice in payments and complements Mastercard‰Ûªs investment in contactless payments to provide merchants of all sizes ‰ÛÒ from international chains to individual shop owners and street vendors ‰ÛÒ a fast, secure and inexpensive way to accept payments.","Access to digital payments will help these businesses expand to new markets, and unlock financial services and products that enables them to grow their livelihoods.This Messenger experience will launch in Nigeria, where Mastercard will pilot a new Masterpass QR bot to help business owners‰Ûª move beyond cash transactions to accepting QR payments.By offering QR-based digital payments, smaller retailers can achieve these goals and create greater customer stickiness with little to no investment beyond the phone they already have,‰Ûù said Jorn Lambert, Executive Vice President, Digital Channels and Regions, Mastercard.Once the account set up process is complete, business owners can print and display the QR code in their stores or save the code on their phones.Customers can pay by either scanning the code from their smartphone or by entering the merchant ID associated with the QR code into their feature phone.","['businesses', 'facebook', 'business', 'messenger', 'uses', 'help', 'digital', 'payments', 'nigeria', 'qr', 'smes', 'code', 'mastercard', 'owners']",,,['Eabw Editor'],2018-04-16 11:57:32+00:00,http://www.busiweek.com/mastercard-uses-facebook-messenger-to-help-smes-go-digital-2/,,,,

"Fred Segal, Mastercard partner for shoppable windows","Dive Brief:Fred Segal in partnership with Mastercard on Wednesday opened an interactive pop-up shop, dubbed ""Rock 'n Roll Holy Land,"" on the Sunset Strip in Los Angeles, featuring shoppable storefront window technology and more than 300 vintage and custom garments from local handmade brand MadeWorn, and memorabilia and special items from the likes of Gene Simmons of KISS and Phil Collen of Def Leppard.The shop features a curated selection of products, including various relics, photographs, and other treasures, ranging from a 50-foot tour bus to historic neon signs. For those who can't stop by during store hours, the digital storefront windows make it shoppable day or night, the companies said. Artists including B-Real & Sen Dog of Cypress Hill will make special appearances throughout the month.Whether shopping through the window or in store, items can be shipped to the address specified during checkout. Mastercard is also working with Snapchat to offer Snapcodes for Mastercard cardholders, according to a press release emailed to Retail Dive.Dive Insight:Since the early 1960s, Fred Segal has been purveyor of merchandise not to be found anywhere else. More recently, the store has been divided up into a series of concessions that recalls the emporium atmosphere of department stores in their hey-day. The tech-enabled shopping opportunities announced Wednesday bring that into the 21st century.""For over 50 years Fred Segal has led the way in experiential retail and we are always looking for unexpected and unique elements that add to the shopping experience,"" Fred Segal President John Frierson said in a statement. ""Partnering with Mastercard allows us to bring our customers an exciting new way to shop that reflects today's digital environment and takes it to the next level.""The interactive shopping environment of Rock 'n Roll Holy Land is the first in a series of collaborations between Mastercard and Fred Segal that will embed the digital display window technology into the store's environment, the companies said.""Fred Segal is a retailer known for offering its customers an innovative and differentiated shopping experience. It makes them an ideal collaborator to bring to life the latest in experiential retail technology, like our shoppable storefront windows,"" Sherri Haymond, Mastercard executive vice president of digital partnerships, said in a statement.""Today, people want to step into a store and do more than just shop; they want it to be a destination that seamlessly blends the digital technology that is a core part of their day to day life with their physical environment.

Mastercard has filed for a patent to improve blockchain transaction speeds,"Barcroft Media via Getty ImagesMasterCard has filed a patent for a system to speed up the activation of new nodes in a blockchain, in an application published by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) on April 26.The application, which was first filed on October 24, 2016, outlines that the current difficulty facing new nodes ‰ÛÒ a computer connected to the blockchain network that stores a copy of the blockchain ‰ÛÒ is that they are required to individually verify a massive amount of data in order to activate.The patent states that new nodes must verify ‰ÛÏthousands, millions, or even billions of transaction records [‰Û_] in a vast number of different blocks‰Ûù that may have accumulated over time in a given blockchain, generating a significant delay before each new node can begin to participate in the network.The patent proposes a technical solution for faster navigation, in which ‰ÛÏfast track flags‰Ûù would be included in block headers, so that new nodes could scan and verify the blockchain at greater speed:‰ÛÏA node in the blockchain network [‰Û_] may quickly navigate the blockchain by identifying blocks that have activated fast track flags. For verification, the node may identify the earlier fast track block (e.g., based on timestamp) and hash that block [‰Û_] and then verify that the fast track reference in the more recent fast track block is the same as the hash of the earlier fast track block.‰ÛùThe patent also outlines the use of software specifically configured to perform querying, hashing, and signatory operations, that would further enhance system efficiency.MasterCard Labs has reportedly filed for over 30 ‰ÛÏpatents related to blockchain tech and cryptocurrency‰Ûù to date. On April 12, USPTO published a MasterCard patent application for tamper-proof distributed storage of identity data on a blockchain system that would prevent abuses, such as identity fraud.In October 2017, the company launched a blockchain system offering business-to-business payments, and submitted a blockchain tech patent for instant payments a month later, in November 2017.Overall, the company appears to be vigorously pro-blockchain, yet anti-Bitcoin. In October 2017, the company‰Ûªs CEO scorned non-government issued cryptocurrencies as ‰ÛÏjunk‰Ûù.This March, a senior MasterCard executive reiterated that the company is receptive to central bank-issued digital currencies only.This post first appeared at CoinTelegraph, the authority on global cryptocurrency markets.

Credit card payments evolve beyond the mobile wallet with more connected devices,"Credit card payments evolve beyond the mobile wallet with more connected deviceshelloPayment networks and manufacturers are building payment functions into more devices -- expanding your options as well as freeing up your hands. Connected ""smart"" accessories such as watches, bands and rings travel lighter than a phone. To use, the wearer holds a wrist or hand up to a contactless payment terminal. Visa tested these devices at the 2016 Rio Olympics to demonstrate possibilities, says Mark Jamison, global head of innovation and design at Visa. (Leo Correa/AP Images for Visa)Mobile wallets can make paying by credit or debit card seamless: Tap your phone at checkout and you're on your way. But mobile wallets are just the beginning. Payment networks and manufacturers are building payment functions into more devices -- expanding your options as well as freeing up your hands.You could find yourself buying gas from the dashboard of your car, groceries from your refrigerator door or dinner by flashing a smile. And you won't even need your phone with you to make purchases on the go.MORE DEVICES ADD PAYMENT CAPABILITYPayment options already available or on the horizon include:‰Û¢ Wearables. Connected ""smart"" accessories such as watches, bands and rings travel lighter than a phone. To use, the wearer holds a wrist or hand up to a contactless payment terminal. Visa tested these devices at the 2016 Rio Olympics to demonstrate possibilities, says Mark Jamison, global head of innovation and design at Visa.The market will determine, he says, if fashion designers want to ""embed payments into a ring or any other device."" One company privately testing similar tech is Token, whose smart ring -- which performs a variety of functions, from opening doors to paying for purchases -- has a waiting list.In 2017, payment capabilities branched out from Apple and Android smartwatches to some Fitbit and Garmin fitness devices, meaning more people could leave their phone behind while working out.By the end of this year, Visa expects merchants to have tap-to-pay capability at 50 percent of U.S. locations where face-to-face transactions take place.‰Û¢ Virtual assistants. When voice payments are enabled on virtual assistants like Amazon Echo and Google Home, you can multi-task and take care of ""errands"" in the moment with verbal commands.CONNECTED DEVICES WILL BE THE NORMConsider the number of mobile applications with saved payment information on your mobile device. In the future, you could free up some data and save a little battery life by using other connected devices:‰Û¢ Cars. Visa and MasterCard are working with manufacturers to embed options in car models. Manufacturers are also testing ways to pay for gas, groceries, takeout, metered parking and other things from screens on vehicle dashboards.""It's still early, but we are focused on bringing that to life this year, to have the ability for you, as the driver, to not just order from one type of merchant,"" says Stephane Wyper, senior vice president of new commerce partnerships and commercialization at MasterCard.Payment networks and manufacturers are building payment functions into more devices -- expanding your options as well as freeing up your hands. Samsung's Family Hub refrigerator, lets users order groceries from the Groceries by MasterCard app. - (AP Photo/Jae C. Hong, File)‰Û¢ Appliances. Appliances will get smarter in the future. A glimpse of what's possible: Samsung's Family Hub refrigerator, which lets you order groceries from the Groceries by MasterCard app; Whirlpool's Smart Dishwasher, which, when synced with an Amazon account, can estimate when you're low on detergent and order it automatically.‰Û¢ Your body. Going totally device-free could also become an option. Biometric payments make it possible to pay by voice, face, iris scan or fingerprint. It's not a big stretch from the biometric authentication currently used by some phones or applications.""The technology itself has been around for a while, but consumers were skeptical of it,"" Jamison says. They've since become accustomed to authenticating using a fingerprint via phone, and their preference has shifted from user ID and password to biometrics, he says.In January 2018, CaliBurger restaurants launched a pay-by-face pilot program in Pasadena, California. Customers pay for their order by smiling for the camera and entering the three-digit number from the back of a credit card.MORE OPTIONS, FEWER PASSWORDSCurrent devices, apps and websites generally each require a separate profile with payment details. In the future, you could keep payment information in one place and sync it to all devices.In 2017, MasterCard launched Consumer Control to offer consumers a central view of their cards across different channels. With access through their issuer, cardholders can add their cards to their favorite shopping sites and devices from one location.The forecast for the future includes more convenient payment options. Visa estimates that 50 billion smart devices will be connected to the internet by 2020.Merchants won't begin accepting payments from everything overnight; for certain devices it may take a few years. For now, you can start exploring the options outside of your mobile wallet.‰Û¢ This article was provided to The Associated Press by the personal finance website NerdWallet.

"Mastercard‰Ûªs signature drop eases user experience, but hikes security pressure","Merchants will no longer need to require a signature for any credit or debit transactions in the U.S. and Canada next year, a move that underscores the fast-changing environment for card security.Merchants for years have complained about the porousness of signatures as a customer verification method and Mastercard finally acknowledged the reality in a Thursday blog post announcing the signature requirement will end after April of 2018.Mastercard said more than 80% of its in-store transactions already occur with no signature, under its Quick Payment Service rules that went into effect in 2012‰ÛÓcurrently mirrored by other card networks‰ÛÓrequiring no signature for supermarket and discount store transactions up to $50 and all other transactions up to $25.Bloomberg NewsVisa, Discover and American Express have so far remained mum on Mastercard‰Ûªs move, but observers expect the other card networks will eventually follow suit.The heat will now be on card networks to reassure consumers of card security through other methods, during the ongoing barrage of data breaches that could undermine consumers‰Ûª confidence in cards, observers day.For merchants, the move should help streamline checkouts and improve consumer convenience, but their biggest benefit will be relief from the previous requirement to physically store a copy of the signature, analysts say.‰ÛÏLarge merchants have said that storing receipt signatures was ridiculously expensive for something that added absolutely no value to payment security,‰Ûù said Julie Conroy, research director at Aite Group.Participating merchants also will need to reprogram terminals that currently prompt for signatures, experts said.The Merchant Advisory Group (MAG) applauded Mastercard‰Ûªs move, noting that signatures long ago lost effectiveness as an authentication method because they were so easy to spoof and virtually impossible to verify, while better methods of authentication were available, including PIN and emerging digital solutions including tokenization and biometrics.‰ÛÏChip technology is an improvement to validate a payment credential but without a PIN, the consumer in possession of the payment card is not authenticated and signature still offers no proof the customer is legitimate,‰Ûù said Laura Townsend, MAG‰Ûªs chief operating officer.MAG continues to advocate for PINs to provide additional layers of security for lost and stolen cards, along with multi-factor authentication, when warranted, for higher-risk transactions, Townsend said.Dispensing with signatures is long overdue, analysts agreed, and card networks are now fast-tracking development of new card-security methods: Adding layers to card authentication processes for in-store and online transactions, including enabling consumers to block their own cards when they‰Ûªre at risk; creating programs enabling merchants to more easily store and manage tokens instead of card numbers, and developing a range of specialized digital and biometric platforms to escalate verification on risky transactions with multiple factors.‰ÛÏSignature is not a great cardholder verification method to begin with, because cashiers don‰Ûªt always check the receipt against the card, undermining the original purpose which was to prove an imposter was using the card in case it was lost or stolen,‰Ûù said Zil Bareisis, a senior analyst with Celent.Mastercard said there is no change in liability for merchants; the existing chargeback rules implemented with the EMV migration still apply.The option to eliminate signature verification only applies to the U.S. and Canada; Mastercard said other regions are still evaluating a change in rules.","Merchants will no longer need to require a signature for any credit or debit transactions in the U.S. and Canada next year, a move that underscores the fast-changing environment for card security.The heat will now be on card networks to reassure consumers of card security through other methods, during the ongoing barrage of data breaches that could undermine consumers‰Ûª confidence in cards, observers day.‰ÛÏLarge merchants have said that storing receipt signatures was ridiculously expensive for something that added absolutely no value to payment security,‰Ûù said Julie Conroy, research director at Aite Group.Mastercard said there is no change in liability for merchants;

Partnering with Mastercard to provide cash and financial services,"The world is facing some of the greatest humanitarian challenges of our time, and at Mercy Corps, we know that no single organization can tackle them alone. So we work across the public and private sectors to bring our unique expertise, innovations and solutions together to spark, scale and sustain change for communities in need around the world.Mercy Corps is incredibly proud of the partnership we have with Mastercard. We believe this partnership embodies the spirit of both organizations, with Mercy Corps and Mastercard contributing unique expertise and ideas and providing greater impact than each individual organization could have alone. Whether responding to natural disasters, promoting inclusive and equitable economic growth or advancing technology in aid and development, Mastercard and Mercy Corps have been working together since 2012 to address some of the world's most pressing challenges and helping to transform lives.Our partnership with Mastercard is comprehensive, integrated and embodies more than just financial support. In addition to providing generous funds to support our programming, Mastercard actively supports Mercy Corps and our mission through innovative technology and products that we are able to incorporate into our global programming. Mastercard employees have also donated their time and skills to help find greater solutions to challenges many communities in the world are facing. Most importantly, our partnership has had real, positive impact ‰ÛÓ reaching more than 80,000 individuals across 12 countries to date.‰ÛÏWe have found Mastercard to be a ‰ÛÏpartner‰Ûù in the true sense of the word,‰Ûù says Britt Rosenberg, director of Corporate Partnerships at Mercy Corps. ‰ÛÏOur partnership draws upon both organizations‰Ûª core strengths ‰ÛÓ Mastercard as a leading technology and payments provider globally, and Mercy Corps as a leading global humanitarian and development organization working in some of the most challenging contexts.‰ÛùLeveraging technology: The power of cash in crisisIn September 2017, Hurricane Maria devastated the island of Puerto Rico, leaving 3.4 million residents to face one of the island‰Ûªs worst natural disasters in decades. Nearly half of Puerto Rico‰Ûªs population lives below the poverty line ‰ÛÓ making the task of recovery even more daunting.Following Maria, Mercy Corps led the way in emergency response with Mastercard prepaid cards to help Puerto Ricans buy the things that they needed most for themselves and their families. Not only does cash provide the dignity of choice after an emergency, but it also stimulates local markets and economies.""I have been able to buy things that I didn't think I would be able to buy,"" says Aide, a Puerto Rico resident and mother of seven children. ""Even if we don't have a bed, now we have food. Even if we don't have electricity, we have food.""Distributing cash through prepaid Mastercard prepaid cards has also supported thousands of refugees in Greece and the Balkans who have fled for safety from countries like Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq. Many of these families are living in limbo, waiting to see what the future holds.‰ÛÏI came from Syria to Turkey, and then to Greece. I suffered a lot,‰Ûù says Hoda, a mother of three and recipient of a prepaid Mastercard. ‰ÛÏCrossing the border from Syria to Turkey we crossed the hills, the muddy roads, we crossed the rivers. We didn‰Ûªt have any things. We stepped into Turkey barefoot, wet from the rain. We were threatened by the police several times‰Ûù.While they wait, prepaid cards have allowed refugees like Hoda to make their own decisions about what they and their family need to buy most ‰ÛÓ things like food, clothing, transportation and communication expenses.Leveraging philanthropy: Overcoming challenges with entrepreneurial opportunitiesMercy Corps‰Ûª partnership with Mastercard has not only helped us meet the world‰Ûªs urgent needs, it has also allowed us to reach vulnerable communities with innovative solutions to financial inclusion and economic growth.In Indonesia, micro and small enterprises play a significant role as drivers of Indonesia‰Ûªs economy through creating job opportunities and business services. In fact, micro and small businesses account for more than 95 percent of all enterprises in Indonesia and employ more than 90 percent of the country‰Ûªs labor force. Despite their importance, many entrepreneurs continue to face significant barriers to optimizing and expanding their business.Mercy Corps and Mastercard are working together to address this challenge and support entrepreneurs in growing their businesses. With financial support from the Mastercard Center for Inclusive Growth, Mercy Corps is working to understand the unique constraints and opportunities entrepreneurs face, and ultimately connect them to the resources they need. Through business and financial training, mentorship and increased access to formal financial institutions, we are helping entrepreneurs to grow their businesses, earn higher incomes and create more jobs.Leveraging people: New frontiers for financial inclusionIn addition to Mastercard providing incredible philanthropic and technology support, Mastercard employees have also invested their time and expertise to support the partnership.‰ÛÏPay it Forward: Doing Well by Doing Good‰Ûù is the first collaborative pro bono project that Mercy Corps and Mastercard have partnered on, integrating Mastercard employee volunteers into critical projects that will strengthen Mercy Corps‰Ûª global programs.This pilot program first began in Nepal, a country Mercy Corps has been working in since 2005. Through savings and credit organizations in rural areas, Mercy Corps provides loans and lines of credit at fair and reasonable rates. Most transactions and record keeping, however, are a manual process, which is becoming increasingly cumbersome and needs to be digitalized for the programs to thrive.‰ÛÏThe rural cooperatives we visited in Nepal lacked basic infrastructure, but there were a lot of opportunities for improvement,‰Ûù says Rodrigo Rodrigues, Mastercard employee volunteer. ‰ÛÏWe realized we needed to build a development roadmap, starting by providing laptops and train the staff to use Excel. After this basic training, future cooperatives can implement more complex solutions such as credit scoring and digital transactions.‰ÛùFollowing a highly competitive process, two Mastercard volunteers ‰ÛÓ Doug Meyer from New York and Rodrigo Rodrigues from Sao Paulo, Brazil ‰ÛÓ were selected to visit Mercy Corps programming in Nepal for two weeks this January. There, they were asked to make a recommendation on how to digitize financial transactions through the use of tablets or mobile apps to pilot with these local groups.The pilot program was ‰ÛÏone of the best experiences of my life,‰Ûù says Doug Meyer, Mastercard employee volunteer. ‰ÛÏMastercard emphasizes the importance of financial inclusion, and it‰Ûªs not just talking the talk. It‰Ûªs giving its employees the opportunity to roll up their sleeves and contribute to the cause directly.‰ÛùThe Mercy Corps and Mastercard partnership demonstrates what is possible when two entities are truly committed to a shared vision and bring their unique skills, knowledge and resources together to make that vision a reality. From providing cash in the midst of disaster to supporting entrepreneurs and driving equitable financial inclusion, Mercy Corps and Mastercard are committed to building a better, stronger world.‰ÛÏA successful partnership is rooted in shared goals,‰Ûù says Leslie Meek-Wohl, director of Global Programs at the Mastercard Center for Inclusive Growth. ‰ÛÏWe share a common vision and values with Mercy Corps that has allowed our partnership to grow and evolve over many years. Taking an innovative approach to using our people, products, and philanthropic programs, we have built a unique partnership that has impacted the lives of thousands of people around the world.‰Ûù","Our partnership with Mastercard is comprehensive, integrated and embodies more than just financial support.Leveraging people: New frontiers for financial inclusionIn addition to Mastercard providing incredible philanthropic and technology support, Mastercard employees have also invested their time and expertise to support the partnership.‰ÛÏPay it Forward: Doing Well by Doing Good‰Ûù is the first collaborative pro bono project that Mercy Corps and Mastercard have partnered on, integrating Mastercard employee volunteers into critical projects that will strengthen Mercy Corps‰Ûª global programs.Through savings and credit organizations in rural areas, Mercy Corps provides loans and lines of credit at fair and reasonable rates.From providing cash in the midst of disaster to supporting entrepreneurs and driving equitable financial inclusion, Mercy Corps and Mastercard are committed to building a better, stronger world.","['cash', 'partnering', 'services', 'financial', 'working', 'technology', 'partnership', 'unique', 'providing', 'corps', 'mercy', 'provide', 'mastercard', 'support']",,,[],,https://reliefweb.int/report/world/partnering-mastercard-provide-cash-and-financial-services,,,,

AmEx Joins Mastercard and Discover in Dumping Signature Requirement,"American Express Co. joined Mastercard Inc. and Discover Financial Services in eliminating a signature requirement for purchases made on its network, a move merchants had been pushing for.AmEx will no longer require customers to sign at checkout for credit- or debit-card purchases beginning in April 2018, the New York-based payments firm said Monday in a statement. The adoption of chip technology and mobile payment options -- which are harder to dupe -- lessened the need for signatures as a fraud-fighting tool, the firm said in the statement.Retailers have complained that the fees they‰Ûªre charged for debit-card payments have climbed following the transition to so-called EMV technology. Merchants have been pushing for card networks to eliminate signature requirements because fees for transactions routed over signature debit networks are often more than double that of comparable networks requiring a personal identification number, or PIN.Read more: Wal-Mart Takes Another Swipe at Fees for Payment Cards‰ÛÏHaving to sign a receipt can be a hassle for customers and is not necessary to prevent fraud at the point of sale,‰Ûù Mike Cook, senior vice president and assistant treasurer at Wal-Mart Stores Inc., said in the statement.

Mastercard says men earn more than women for equal performance,"Women who work at Mastercard Inc. earn 99.1 cents for every dollar men make for ‰ÛÏequal performance at the same level,‰Ûù according to a report the company released Monday.Bloomberg NewsThe payments network said it will take steps to close this gender pay gap in its current compensation cycle.Mastercard examines its pay practices annually, and ‰ÛÏif disparities are found and not explained in an acceptable manner, appropriate responsive action is taken,‰Ûù the report said. Its 0.9 percent pay gap is less than the commonly cited national average of 17 percent, which is based on median hourly earnings and doesn‰Ûªt take into account job title, seniority and other factors that affect compensation. Pay discrimination based on gender is against federal law.A number of financial-services firms, including Citigroup Inc. and Wells Fargo & Co., have recently disclosed the difference in compensation for their male and female employees. All have said the gap is around 1 percent, after adjusting for factors such as job title, seniority and geography. Most have declined to reveal the calculations that go into that adjustment.‰ÛÏGender equality is the foundational core of our commitment to building an inclusive, high-performing culture at the company,‰Ûù the Mastercard report said. ‰ÛÏWe remain dedicated to maintaining practices designed to ensure there is equal pay for equal performance at the same level.‰ÛùBloomberg News","Women who work at Mastercard Inc. earn 99.1 cents for every dollar men make for ‰ÛÏequal performance at the same level,‰Ûù according to a report the company released Monday.Bloomberg NewsThe payments network said it will take steps to close this gender pay gap in its current compensation cycle.All have said the gap is around 1 percent, after adjusting for factors such as job title, seniority and geography.‰ÛÏGender equality is the foundational core of our commitment to building an inclusive, high-performing culture at the company,‰Ûù the Mastercard report said.‰ÛÏWe remain dedicated to maintaining practices designed to ensure there is equal pay for equal performance at the same level.‰ÛùBloomberg News","['men', 'earn', 'gap', 'equal', 'report', 'women', 'pay', 'practices', 'compensation', 'title', 'performance', 'mastercard', 'seniority']",,,[],2018-02-13 09:35:46.081000-05:00,https://www.paymentssource.com/articles/mastercard-says-men-earn-more-than-women-for-equal-performance,,,,

What is mean by High Beta Stock?: Mastercard Incorporated (MA) ‰ÛÒ Investor News Place,"Mastercard Incorporated (MA) closed the Wednesday at final price of $192.99 after traded 2529942 shares. The average volume was noted at 3859.2K shares while its relative volume was seen at 0.63. Volume is important because it shows the level of interest in a stock. Current volume in a stock, relative to prior volume, shows if interest is higher or lower in a stock than it was before. High volume, or relatively high volume (compared to prior volume), is more suitable for active traders. Very low volume typically indicates a lack of interest and usually little price movement. Short Ratio of stock is 1.77. Mastercard Incorporated is a part of Financial sector and belongs to Credit Services industry. The recent session has given its stock price a 62.21% upward lead over its 52-week low and showed lower move of -0.89% over its 52-week high.The 52 week range is a simple technical indicator that lists the highest and lowest price at which a security was sold over preceding 52 weeks (or one year). Investors, especially technical analysts, may use the 52 week range to gauge whether a stock‰Ûªs current price suggests buying, selling, or taking no-action. Many value investors look for stocks that are at or near their 52 week low, but this metric alone does not indicate whether a stock is under-valued. For example, a stock may near its 52 week low in a price correction after earnings expectations for future quarters were revised. There is no guarantee that when share prices reach a 52 week low, the stock will begin to trade higher ‰ÛÒ it could break down to an even lower level. However, as 52 Week Range has little to no connection whatsoever with current news or forces affecting companies today, very few investors rely heavily on the metric. Instead, the 52 Week Range is generally used more as a descriptive metric to describe what the stock has done and not what it will do.The stock price volatility remained at 1.58% in recent month and reaches at 1.14% for the week. Historical statistical volatility is a measure of how much the stock price fluctuated during a given time period. While historical volatility can be indicative of future volatility, it can also differ greatly from future volatility, depending on what was driving the price changes during the past period. Major expected news items are more important drivers of big moves in the stock price in the near future. The Average True Range (ATR) is also a measure of volatility is currently sitting at 3Mastercard Incorporated (MA) stock is more volatile Stock with beta figure of 1.18Mastercard Incorporated stock waking on thin line between bulls and bears tracks and with several factors it‰Ûªs pulling towards optimistic side to some extend but some take to pessimistic side. So, volatility evaluation is supposed to give some wisdom of how far the stock will fall if the market takes a dive and how high the stock will rise if the bull starts to climb. For this relative risk measurement, MA has beta value of 1.18.Once the concept of beta is understood, an investor can intuitively determine whether or not a particular stock has a high or low beta. For example, an established blue chip company in a mature industry with stable earnings will most likely have a much lower beta compared to a start up Biotechnology Company.The overall market is assigned a beta of 1.0. Stocks that are volatile and move more than the overall market have a beta greater than 1 while stocks with price swings less than the market have a beta less than 1.0. To dig out factors, always good to learn who else owns shares, the institutional owner includes mutual funds and pension funds are major players. They buy or sell in enormous chunks. Whether a stock is in or out of their favor can have a big effect on its price.Mastercard Incorporated (MA) Stock Price Analysis:It is a positive indicator for investor portfolio value ‰ÛÓ when the price of a stock Investor owns goes up in value. On the other side it is not a negative indicator for Investor portfolio value when the price of a stock Investor owns moves down in value. After the giving short look at one day return of Mastercard Incorporated it is observed that MA reported positive return of 0.71% in last trading session.Now we move forward to see the historical returns of Mastercard Incorporated which is USA based stock. The stock is currently showing up return of 0.32% throughout last week and witnessed increasing return of 11.40% in one month period. The stock price jumped 11.59% in three months and increased 29.04% for the last six months trading period.MA indicated a yearly positive return of 61.36% while year-to-date (YTD) return printed 27.50% rising outlook. The stock price moved -0.89% off its 50 Day low and changed 14.92% to its 50 Day high.Moving average of Mastercard Incorporated (MA)Mastercard Incorporated (MA) stock price traded at a gap of 3.12% from an average price of last twenty days and stands at a distance of 6.97% away from it‰Ûªs an average price of recent fifty days. Take a look at most-well known 200-day moving average which averages prices over the past 200 days. The 200-day moving average is the standby for long-term investors. At present time the stock is moving 21.40% away to its 200-day moving average. It goes without saying that investors should not rely solely on any one technique. However, applying moving-average strategies in conjunction with portfolio diversification and prudent money management may reduce one‰Ûªs risk substantially.Mastercard Incorporated (MA) stock is Overbought or Oversold?The stock has current RSI value of 66.12. Wilder believed that when prices rose very rapidly and therefore momentum was high enough, that the underlying financial instrument/commodity would have to eventually be considered overbought and a selling opportunity was possibly at hand. Likewise, when prices dropped rapidly and therefore momentum was low enough, the financial instrument would at some point be considered oversold presenting a possible buying opportunity.There are set number ranges within RSI that Wilder consider useful and noteworthy in this regard. According to Wilder, any number above 70 should be considered overbought and any number below 30 should be considered oversold. An RSI between 30 and 70 was to be considered neutral and an RSI around 50 signified no trend. ‰ÛÒ Some traders believe that Wilder‰Ûªs overbought/oversold ranges are too wide and choose to alter those ranges. For example, someone might consider any number above 80 as overbought and anything below 20 as undersold. This is entirely at the trader‰Ûªs discretion.","Major expected news items are more important drivers of big moves in the stock price in the near future.Once the concept of beta is understood, an investor can intuitively determine whether or not a particular stock has a high or low beta.Mastercard Incorporated (MA) Stock Price Analysis:It is a positive indicator for investor portfolio value ‰ÛÓ when the price of a stock Investor owns goes up in value.The stock price jumped 11.59% in three months and increased 29.04% for the last six months trading period.Moving average of Mastercard Incorporated (MA)Mastercard Incorporated (MA) stock price traded at a gap of 3.12% from an average price of last twenty days and stands at a distance of 6.97% away from it‰Ûªs an average price of recent fifty days.","['stock', 'week', 'beta', 'average', 'low', 'incorporated', 'mean', 'investor', 'ma', 'high', 'volume', 'mastercard', '52', 'place', 'price', 'volatility']",,,['Camilla Alex'],,http://www.wallstreetinvestorplace.com/2018/05/what-is-mean-by-high-beta-stock-mastercard-incorporated-ma-2/,,,,

As traders, we are more interested to take part in strong moves and don‰Ûªt join moves that show weakness ‰ÛÒ or we may even watch for an entry in the opposite direction of a weak move. These guidelines do not hold true in all situations, but they are a good general aid in trading decisions.Currently, the 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) reading is at 68.35. As you can see RSI calculation is fairly simple. The objective of using RSI is to help the trader identify over sold and overbought price areas. Overbought implies that the positive momentum in the stock is so high that it may not be sustainable for long and hence there could be a correction. Likewise, an oversold position indicates that the negative momentum is high leading to a possible reversal.When the RSI reading is between 30 and 0, the security is supposed to be oversold and ready for an upward correction. When the security reading is between 70 and 100, the security is supposed to be heavily bought and is ready for a downward correction.

MasterCard has finally realized that signatures are obsolete and stupid,"For years, credit card companies have relied on an illegible squiggly line as the frontline of defense against credit card fraud. Customers are forced to use a pen (how retro!) to scrawl their signature on bills at restaurants and sign digitally at cash registers‰ÛÒas if somehow in the age of chips, PINs, biometrics, and online fraud alerts, a line on a page is still a great tool against fraud prevention. Personally, I have been known to sign on the dotted line with a doodle of a piece of tofu and no one has ever stopped me, because signatures mean very little in this digital age.Companies are finally seeing the light. Starting in April 2018, MasterCard cardholders will no longer be required to sign their name when they purchase something using their debit or credit cards.The company has been moving away from requiring signatures for a few years now, with only about 80% of purchases (typically over a certain dollar amount) requiring a signature these days.

Mastercard Flips The Switch On Payments' Power,"Most of the world doesn‰Ûªt think much about flipping on the lights. In fact, one favored metaphor for describing something easy is comparing it to ‰ÛÏflipping a switch.‰ÛùBut for 1.1 billion people worldwide, turning on the lights is anything but ‰ÛÏflip a switch‰Ûù easy, Kiki Del Valle, SVP of Commerce for Every Device for Mastercard, told Karen Webster in a recent conversation on the eve of Mobile World Congress‰Ûª kickoff in Spain.Half of those people live in sub-Saharan Africa, and all endure friction in the course of everyday activities that would likely be unimaginable to people living in first-world countries. Cooking means walking long distances for kerosene. Businesses can only operate for as long as the sun is up, since there is no power to light the insides of those stores. For most, studying also becomes daytime acidity.It‰Ûªs not a terribly healthy way to live, Del Valle said, but building the kind of infrastructure necessary to power those areas has proven prohibitively costly ‰ÛÒ but, as she noted, that is changing. Solar panels are more easily transported and installed, and that technology is ‰ÛÏleapfrogging‰Ûù more standard methods of power transmission. That is great progress, Del Valle said, but it‰Ûªs not enough as is ‰ÛÒ because even those units are costly by the standards of these rural dwellers.‰ÛÏA lot of the population that doesn‰Ûªt have electricity also doesn‰Ûªt have a big budget,‰Ûù she said. ‰ÛÏWhat we need to solve for here is a couple of different things, to really make access possible.‰ÛùSolving for Solar With PartnershipsThe trick, Del Valle told Webster, is to offer something old, but with a twist in how power is consumed and paid for ‰ÛÒ metered payments ‰ÛÒ with a little help from some friends.Starting in Sub-Saharan Africa.On one side, she noted, is the provider of the service ‰ÛÒ in this case, M-KOPA, which provides the consumer with the solar kit that includes the panel itself, a radio, a television (an option) and charging for various devices.On the other side are the payments providers, which in this case are the telcos and the banks providing the service for Uganda, where the pilot is taking place. Mastercard, with its Masterpass QR system, provides the rails that join the two end points together ‰ÛÒ and allows the consumer to direct funds.How that plays out in reality, Del Valle explained, is that the consumer first makes a down payment on the solar kit to M-KOPA. When they wish to purchase power access ‰ÛÒ say, 10 cents worth for the day ‰ÛÒ they can do so via a phone, any phone. If using a smartphone, it will be done via an app, or via text message on a feature phone. Either way, the consumer gets a QR code that enables payment.The consumer, based on how they prefer to manage their money, can then set that payment to come from their bank account ‰ÛÒ or from their telco‰Ûªs mobile payment account ‰ÛÒ and send it. The payment gets to M-KOPA, which has integrated with the Mastercard API, which then leverages IoT technology to switch on the battery and provide electricity to the consumer.Once the consumer has run through their pre-paid allotment, the battery shuts off and they are free to purchase more as needed.Solar, Del Valle noted, is just one example ‰ÛÒ and one they are rolling out in Uganda in the next few months, with plans for wider release soon to follow.‰ÛÏBut this is much bigger, and can work for a lot of utilities, such as water, gas and other basic needs as well,‰Ûù she noted. ‰ÛÏThis is very much about giving customers the right tools so they can track usage, manage their budget and control their resource use with better payment options.‰ÛùEngaging the Bigger MarketThe work the firm is doing in Uganda, Del Valle explained, is one piece of the largest strategy to help bring more customers into the global digital payments transformation ‰ÛÒ without having to demand a lot more of those consumers.‰ÛÏThe question in every market is where consumers are storing value ‰ÛÒ which is why it is so important for us to work with mobile operators,‰Ûù Del Valle said, adding that in many places, they have the trusted relationship with the consumer and can become a platform to enable additional third-party services.The service Mastercard can provide, she noted, is to serve as the network sitting beneath those emerging networks, which moves money securely between all those new endpoints. From their point of view, Del Valle said, the market is ‰ÛÏat a tipping point in its evolution‰Ûù where mobile operators are moving beyond their core operations to provide a new world of services to consumers.Taking an even further step back, she pointed out, the entire emerging digital ecosystem ‰ÛÒ populated by issuers, merchants and device manufacturers ‰ÛÒ is seeking ways to build out better and more innovative services across channels and devices. And all of those players need a player to integrate the technology behind the scenes.The Mastercard Engage platform, which will get a more comprehensive introduction at MWC this week, is intended to act as the connective tissue that accelerates time to market for those consumer innovations.‰ÛÏToday‰Ûªs digital world unlocks new opportunities for businesses, but they need the right resources to turn their ideas into reality,‰Ûù Del Valle noted. ‰ÛÏBy expanding Engage to connect more customers with the right partners, they are able to independently assess those partners and focus on the bigger picture of making a positive impact around the world.‰ÛùThose impacts will vary depending on who they are for, and what problem they are focused on solving. The players in need of connection will vary as well ‰ÛÒ in the developed world, the story may be more about connecting issuers to IoT players, whereas in a developing ecosystem, that issuer role will much more likely be played by a mobile carrier.But for those who benefit from the services enabled, Del Valle noted, the real difference will be measured in what is possible afterward, as compared to what was possible before.And that will make it almost as easy as flipping a switch.","Solar panels are more easily transported and installed, and that technology is ‰ÛÏleapfrogging‰Ûù more standard methods of power transmission.That is great progress, Del Valle said, but it‰Ûªs not enough as is ‰ÛÒ because even those units are costly by the standards of these rural dwellers.Solar, Del Valle noted, is just one example ‰ÛÒ and one they are rolling out in Uganda in the next few months, with plans for wider release soon to follow.‰ÛÏToday‰Ûªs digital world unlocks new opportunities for businesses, but they need the right resources to turn their ideas into reality,‰Ûù Del Valle noted.But for those who benefit from the services enabled, Del Valle noted, the real difference will be measured in what is possible afterward, as compared to what was possible before.","['payment', 'switch', 'valle', 'del', 'world', 'payments', 'solar', 'power', 'flips', 'mobile', 'consumer', 'mastercard', 'noted']",,,[],2018-02-26 06:00:13+00:00,https://www.pymnts.com/mastercard/2018/mastercard-payments-solar-power-mobile-pay-masterpass/,,,,

Sears gets $425M boost from Citi credit card deal that also boosts shopper benefits,"A Sears store. (Photo: Sears Holdings)If you're using the Sears credit card to ""shop your way,"" you may find the discounts and deals are about to get better.But the best deal of all will be for Sears' parent company, which is about to get a much-needed injection of $425 million due to the upgraded credit-card deal with Citi.Sears Holdings, which has both the Sears and Kmart chains, announced Monday that it is extending and enhancing its deal with the bank for a Mastercard branded with the retailer's Shop Your Way loyalty program.The changes include improved card benefits, such as additional points for certain purchases, including eligible items at Sears and Kmart stores.For Sears, which faces a financial crisis as its sales suffer, the deal provides fresh financial runway. Citi is paying $425 million as part of the arrangement.Sears' stock soared 10.9% to $3.98 in pre-market trading as investors celebrated the sudden influx of cash, but it settled back later in the day to $3.61, essentially unchanged from Friday.To extend the new terms of the deal through Dec. 31, 2020, Sears gave up the right to purchase certain assets tied to the credit card program.‰ÛÏWe‰Ûªre extremely proud of our longstanding relationship with Citi and are excited that this best-in-class offer which rewards Shop Your Way members for activity in their daily lives is now an ongoing part of the value proposition for cardholders,‰Ûù Sears CEO Edward Lampert said in a statement.Cardmembers can earn points to be redeemed on Kmart household items, larger products such as kitchen appliances at Sears and glasses at Sears Optical.Shop Your Way Mastercard now includes 5% back in points on certain purchases at gas stations, 3% back on certain purchases at grocery stores and restaurants, 2% back on eligible items at Sears and Kmart and 1% on ""other eligible purchases.""Members already earn points on other activity, such as the Uber and GasBuddy apps.CLOSE It‰Ûªs one of Sears‰Ûª ‰ÛÏcrown jewels.‰Ûù TimeFollow USA TODAY reporter Nathan Bomey on Twitter @NathanBomey.Read or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2GyR3XP","(Photo: Sears Holdings)If you're using the Sears credit card to ""shop your way,"" you may find the discounts and deals are about to get better.But the best deal of all will be for Sears' parent company, which is about to get a much-needed injection of $425 million due to the upgraded credit-card deal with Citi.The changes include improved card benefits, such as additional points for certain purchases, including eligible items at Sears and Kmart stores.To extend the new terms of the deal through Dec. 31, 2020, Sears gave up the right to purchase certain assets tied to the credit card program.Cardmembers can earn points to be redeemed on Kmart household items, larger products such as kitchen appliances at Sears and glasses at Sears Optical.","['card', 'citi', 'shop', 'eligible', 'items', 'deal', 'gets', 'benefits', 'kmart', 'purchases', 'sears', 'boost', 'points', 'certain', 'boosts', 'credit', 'shopper', 'way']",,,"['Nathan Bomey', 'Published A.M.

How Mastercard‰Ûªs CMO Spends Half of His Time At CES Roaming for Ideas,"Nobody knew who he was, and nobody asked. He blended into the crowd, bespectacled and wearing a sweater over his gingham-style button-down shirt. He wasn‰Ûªt wearing his name tag, which perhaps let him saunter past the stands, past promise after promise about the future of technology. He moved slowly yet methodically from booth to booth at the Consumer Electronics Show, the largest tech trade show in the world.But here was Raja Rajamannar‰ÛÓthe chief marketing officer for Mastercard, one of the most well-known brands in the world‰ÛÓjust casually asking questions incognito, occasionally picking up a business card or perusing a pamphlet. The folks operating these booths had no idea that the man they were talking to was responsible for spending $587 million on advertising and marketing in the first three quarters of 2017 alone.‰ÛÏOne of the things that fascinates me is the number of people with the same type of product,‰Ûù he said. ‰ÛÏHow do they even market themselves? Your heart goes out to them, because they‰Ûªre out here, they‰Ûªre spending money, and many of the times, people just come and go away.‰ÛùWhile many marketers spend much of their time at CES in meetings, Rajamannar spends half of his time on what could seem like a wild goose chase. But for him, there‰Ûªs a strong business imperative to walk the floor and press the flesh. While he doesn‰Ûªt always know if there will be a use case as he pops by booths, he said it never hurts to grab a card to check out later.‰ÛÏWe are trying to stay ahead of the developments that are happening in the marketplace,‰Ûù he said on the second day of the convention. ‰ÛÏAnd if there is promise in any concept, we are catching it early in its lifecycle, which means the economics will be better for us, the competitive advantage will be better for us. And if one concept out of 10, 15, 20, whatever it is that we try works, it‰Ûªs well worth it.‰ÛùWalking the gauntlet of more than 4,000 companies, Rajamannar scans for four types of technologies he thinks are important to the future of Mastercard: payments, voice and other artificial intelligence, consumer interfaces (wearables and other connected devices), and security.‰ÛÏWhat I try to do is to understand where consumers‰Ûª apprehensions are,‰Ûù he said. ‰ÛÏAnd if you ask consumers what is the thing that is most important for them in a payment product, it‰Ûªs security. Which makes sense because you‰Ûªre dealing with money, and you want it to be safe. Then it is up to us as marketers to understand what gives them a sense of confidence, what gives them peace of mind, what makes them feel that this product is more secure than anything else?‰ÛùOver the course of an hour, Adweek walked the floor with Rajamannar, listening and watching how he chooses which booths to stop by and how these technologies fit into his business‰Ûªs goals.VoiceThe first stop for Rajamannar: a booth for VocaliD, a Massachusetts-based company that creates, stores and preserves vocal identities. He said every brand is exploring the possibilities of voice these days, often for brand engagement. For Mastercard, however, it could bolster account security.‰ÛÏThese guys are talking about customizing voices,‰Ûù he said. ‰ÛÏWhen I see something like this, one of the things I keep thinking about is every marketer is talking about getting into the voice space. When you‰Ûªre in the voice space, there is no visual, so everything is identification of your sonic signature, your sonic branding.‰ÛùVoice is an area of increased interest for Mastercard. It also seems to be something that‰Ûªs of at least some interest to Mastercard‰Ûªs customers. According to Mastercard‰Ûªs digital payments study released in early 2017 analyzed 3.5 million conversations across various social channels. The study, which was conducted by PRIME Research and Synthesio, found that about 20 percent of those conversations expressed an interest in smart assistants. That percentage has likely increased as Siri, Alexa and Google Home become increasingly popular and more useful in daily life.Connected devicesRajamannar stopped to talk with a connected bicycle company based in France called Velco, whose connected handlebars and navigational tools fit in with Mastercard‰Ûªs interest in smart cities. For example, in London, Mastercard‰Ûªs technology powers payments for the bus system. It‰Ûªs also working on helping governments with analytical support: Where should the next shopping mall be, and what kind of shops should be there? Where should the next stadium go? Where do tourists like to visit?‰ÛÏTransit is one of the bottlenecks,‰Ûù he said. ‰ÛÏYou have to stand in a queue to buy a ticket, or a turnstile, so we think about how can we make it very seamless. Plus, can you integrate all public transit?‰ÛùSecurityBellus3D, a 3-D scanning company, caught his eye. The technology‰ÛÓwhich can scan a person‰Ûªs face via a smartphone or tablet and then use for face recognition, gaming or other types of simulation‰ÛÓcould someday help with security, like the iPhone X‰Ûªs face unlock feature.Security is a ‰ÛÏpassion point‰Ûù that Mastercard is focusing on. One possibility may be a physical, tangible solution fingerprint reading for in-store purchases, such as the credit card with a built-in fingerprint scanner the company released last year.‰ÛÏThe key thing is: how do you stay ahead of the bad guys?‰Ûù he said. ‰ÛÏ[T]he more convenient a thing is to the consumer, [the more] convenient for somebody to break in.‰ÛùPaymentsFood might sound like a strange niche for Mastercard, but it takes money to buy food. (After all, there‰Ûªs no such thing as a free lunch.) So Rajamannar stopped at Robomart, a small vending machine on wheels that allows people to purchase snacks.A self-driving store could have applications for relatively low-traffic areas, he explained, which are maybe more distant for people to visit. Also, it could help to driver on-demand purchases.‰ÛÏWith something like this, I see a lot of possibilities,‰Ûù he said. ‰ÛÏFor a self-serving store, obviously honesty is very critical, and you want to make sure you‰Ûªre getting your payments before they take something. I think you have an identification system out here where you‰Ûªre going with your card and tapping. And if there is a way I can capture what you bought and bill you or debit your card, that‰Ûªs a fantastic experience.‰Ûù","‰ÛÏOne of the things that fascinates me is the number of people with the same type of product,‰Ûù he said.It also seems to be something that‰Ûªs of at least some interest to Mastercard‰Ûªs customers.According to Mastercard‰Ûªs digital payments study released in early 2017 analyzed 3.5 million conversations across various social channels.Connected devicesRajamannar stopped to talk with a connected bicycle company based in France called Velco, whose connected handlebars and navigational tools fit in with Mastercard‰Ûªs interest in smart cities.‰ÛÏFor a self-serving store, obviously honesty is very critical, and you want to make sure you‰Ûªre getting your payments before they take something.","['card', 'interest', 'mastercard', 'roaming', 'rajamannar', 'half', 'payments', 'ideas', 'ces', 'voice', 'company', 'mastercards', 'youre', 'spends', 'thing', 'cmo']",,,[],,http://www.adweek.com/digital/how-mastercards-cmo-spends-half-of-his-time-at-ces-roaming-for-ideas/,,,,

Mastercard Pullback Is a Gift Worth Buying,"Don't pass up the chance to buy a great company on a discount, TheStreet's Jim Cramer said on CNBC's ""Stop Trading"" segment Tuesday. After Visa (V) reported ""great"" earnings results last week, shares of both Visa and Mastercard (MA) were on the move higher, he pointed out.However, on Tuesday before the open, Mastercard reported great results of its own, beating on earnings and revenue estimates. Sales jumped 18.1% year-over-year and even though margins slipped 90 basis points, earnings of $1.34 per share came in well ahead of the $1.23 consensus estimates.Mastercard's only flaw? Rallying into the quarter due to Visa's results, Cramer said. Shares are still up 42% on the year.Investors won't get many buying opportunities in names like Visa and Mastercard, which just keep climbing on the year. So with Mastercard stock down, ""it's a gift,"" reasoned Cramer, who also manages the Action Alerts PLUS charitable trust portfolio.

Mastercard to create 175 new high-tech jobs in Dublin,"Mastercard, which already employs more than 200 people at its research and development centre in Dublin, is to create 175 new tech jobs in Ireland as it looks to bring more digital payment solutions to market.The company said it is looking to hire across a number of areas, with new roles for software engineers, blockchain specialists, data scientists, project managers, analysts, product designers, cloud infrastructure specialists and information security experts.The payments giant employs about 380 people in total at its facility in Leopardstown, where the global headquarters of its R&D arm Mastercard Labs is headquartered.The lab is focused on digital payment solutions, such as the QKR app, which is used by Wagamama, Zizzi and Ask Italian in the UK. The lab is also looking at virtual and augmented reality experiences that will change the way we shop, and at chatbots that can help consumers book flights or order takeaways without leaving messaging apps.Artificial intelligenceIn addition, teams at the centre are exploring a range of blockchain solutions, as well as using artificial intelligence to help secure payments.Mastercard Labs opened in Dublin in 2012, although the operator of the world‰Ûªs second-largest payments network has had a base in Ireland since late 2008 following its $100 million (‰âÂ81 million) acquisition of Irish firm Orbiscom.In addition to the R&D work undertaken locally, Mastercard‰Ûªs Leopardstown office is also home to the company‰Ûªs main business in Ireland, which is working with banks and credit card issuers to deliver payment services to consumers and businesses.Mastercard said it has taken on more space at its Mountainview headquarters and has signed a lease until 2026, to accommodate growing numbers of staff.The jobs announcement comes just two months after the payments company announced a major restructuring to coincide with the departure of Garry Lyons, who set-up Mastercard Labs here in 2012.Mastercard said in early February it planned to merge its digital and physical payments team under one organisation following Mr Lyons departure. While the man who previously led Orbiscom has left to establish a new venture, he is staying on as an advisor to Mastercard and his new company will be providing services to his former employer.‰ÛÏIreland is the heart of our global innovation efforts. Throughout Mastercard, Dublin is admired as a key technology hub. We‰Ûªre looking to replicate the innovation culture we‰Ûªve fostered here in our offices around the world,‰Ûù said Ken Moore, executive vice-president and head of Mastercard Labs.‰ÛÏThe vibrant culture we have here makes it the perfect place to recruit for these highly-skilled roles.

Mastercard pilots QR payments bot on Messenger,"Brief:Mastercard, the payments giant that processed 65 billion transactions last year, said it will use Facebook Messenger to provide technology to small businesses in Africa and Asia to boost electronic and mobile payments. The company is expanding its Masterpass QR platform, which enables mobile phone owners to accept and make in-person purchases without cash or a plastic card, according to a company statement.Starting with Nigeria, Mastercard will pilot a Masterpass QR bot to help businesses make the transition from cash transactions to QR payments, per a statement. The country is heavily dependent on cash, with 98% of the $301 billion of consumer-to-business transactions being conducted with paper currency, per a Mastercard study.Ecobank and Zenith Bank are supporting the inaugural program in Nigeria as part of a larger plan by the two companies to get more businesses into the digital economy. Businesses can get started by sending a request to the bot to enable QR payments, receive approval from the bank, set up an account and start accepting digital payments, per a statement.Insight:The news points to how, as smartphone adoption continues to grow worldwide, mobile payments could offer an opportunity for cash-based economies to go digital. QR codes are the basis of popular mobile payments platforms like Starbucks' because they are relatively easy to use and can be leveraged across device types. At the same time, messaging apps like Messenger are popular worldwide and, as WeChat has shown, consumers in other countries are eager to use them for a variety of purposes, including making purchase.Developing regions in Asia and Africa have an opportunity to leapfrog ahead into mobile payments, as urban areas of China have done in the past few years. While mobile payments have been hindered in the U.S., which has a well established infrastructure to make card transactions quick and easy, countries like Nigeria can drive faster adoption of digital payments with a phone.For banks, that means a bigger opportunity to offer a greater range of financial services to cash-dependent small retailers that likely have never seen a need to step into a bank branch and open an account. By relying on Facebook Messenger and QR codes that can be scanned with most models of smartphones, digital payment methods have an opportunity to grow in countries like Nigeria.Facebook has targeted developing markets for growth with such offerings as its Free Basics, a mobile app that gives users free access to a small selection of data-light websites and services. The websites don‰Ûªt load data-heavy photos and videos and can be browsed without paying for mobile data. While Facebook seeks to get more people online and demonstrate how connectivity can improve their lives, the social network also has faced criticism for ‰ÛÏdigital colonialism‰Ûù that doesn‰Ûªt adequately serve local populations in their native language, features U.S.-based companies, gathers data about users and violates the principles of net neutrality, per the Guardian. Facebook has a chance to extend goodwill to developing markets by making payments easier.","Brief:Mastercard, the payments giant that processed 65 billion transactions last year, said it will use Facebook Messenger to provide technology to small businesses in Africa and Asia to boost electronic and mobile payments.Starting with Nigeria, Mastercard will pilot a Masterpass QR bot to help businesses make the transition from cash transactions to QR payments, per a statement.Businesses can get started by sending a request to the bot to enable QR payments, receive approval from the bank, set up an account and start accepting digital payments, per a statement.Insight:The news points to how, as smartphone adoption continues to grow worldwide, mobile payments could offer an opportunity for cash-based economies to go digital.QR codes are the basis of popular mobile payments platforms like Starbucks' because they are relatively easy to use and can be leveraged across device types.","['businesses', 'facebook', 'small', 'messenger', 'digital', 'bot', 'opportunity', 'payments', 'transactions', 'nigeria', 'mobile', 'qr', 'mastercard', 'pilots']",,,"['Robert Williams', 'Share It']",3/1/18 11:08,https://www.mobilemarketer.com/news/mastercard-pilots-qr-payments-bot-on-messenger/518150/,,,,
"Sign away: Visa, Mastercard, American Express no longer mandate signatures","The ages-old practice of signing the receipt after debit and credit card transactions will be a thing of the past as early as Friday, as major U.S. credit card companies announced its phase-out.Three of the four major credit card companies ‰ÛÓ Mastercard and American Express ‰ÛÓ announced that they will allow customers to forgo signing their card purchases. Discover also will join Mastercard and American Express on Friday, according to The Verge. Visa, the largest credit card issuer in the United States, will join Saturday.Start your day with the news you need from the Bay Area and beyond.Sign up for our ew Morning Report weekday newsletter.The four companies are making the switch thanks to microchips now commonly found embedded in credit and debit cards. The chips carry unique codes for each transaction to make it more difficult to copy and reduce fraud rates, thus making the signature obsolete. Mastercard told The New York Times that it had wanted to phase out the signature for a long time but needed to wait until chip-embedded cards became commonplace.In a statement last week about the April 13 phase-out, Mastercard conducted a survey to see how many Americans were annoyed by the signature, which was introduced in the 1950s. It found 55 percent of customers rarely signed their names beyond sales receipts.‰ÛÏIn our digital, fast-paced marketplace, consumers appreciate any opportunity to save time. This is why Mastercard led the charge to officially ‰Û÷retire‰Ûª cardholder signatures from store receipts,‰Ûù said Linda Kirkpatrick, an executive vice president with Mastercard. ‰ÛÏMerchants recognize that cardholder signatures have limited use, and are embracing this change to create efficiency for their customers.‰ÛùWhile the credit card companies are no longer making signatures mandatory, retailers have the choice to keep signatures. Target and Walmart, for example, plan to rid of card signatures later this month, according to The Verge. Square, a San Francisco-based mobile payment service that works with small retailers, does not plan to immediately update its systems to allow retailers to skip the signature, according to the Times.The news of credit card companies phasing out the signature was reported months ago. In October, Mastercard became the first company to announce the transition; American Express and Discover joined in December. Visa followed suit in January.In Australia and Europe, signatures already have gone extinct. Credit card purchases are authenticated by inserting the card with a microchip into the reader and typing in a four-digit PIN to verify. While U.S. card companies adopted microchipped credit cards in 2015, they have not come around to mandating PINs with the credit cards.The new rules involving card signatures will also vary depending on the card company, according to the Times. American Express is the most expansive, as the new rules affect every one of its cards around the world. Mastercard‰Ûªs only affect the United States and Canada, while Discover‰Ûªs applies to both countries plus Mexico and the Caribbean.Visa is the most limited as it applies the changes as optional in all of North America ‰ÛÓ and only for retailers with payment systems that can read chip cards.","The ages-old practice of signing the receipt after debit and credit card transactions will be a thing of the past as early as Friday, as major U.S. credit card companies announced its phase-out.Three of the four major credit card companies ‰ÛÓ Mastercard and American Express ‰ÛÓ announced that they will allow customers to forgo signing their card purchases.Discover also will join Mastercard and American Express on Friday, according to The Verge.While U.S. card companies adopted microchipped credit cards in 2015, they have not come around to mandating PINs with the credit cards.The new rules involving card signatures will also vary depending on the card company, according to the Times.","['card', 'visa', 'express', 'signature', 'american', 'companies', 'mandate', 'sign', 'retailers', 'longer', 'away', 'cards', 'signatures', 'credit', 'mastercard']",,,"['Seung Lee', 'Seung Covers Apple', 'Personal Technology For The Bay Area News Group.

MasterCard: deciphering the impossible,"It is a case that competition litigators love to talk about and the first panel of the day did just that; traversing the issues around expert evidence and the CAT‰Ûªs requirements for certification of the largest consumer class action ever to be brought in the United Kingdom.It may have courted mixed views over whether such a large claim had legs to be brought under the Competition Appeal Tribunal‰Ûªs opt-out collective actions regime, but the GBP 14 billion claim was boldly advanced by Walter Merricks CBE, via his team of lawyers at Quinn, Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan, on behalf of almost 50,000 MasterCard consumers.In her role as chair, Travers Smith‰Ûªs Caroline Edwards kicked off a lively discussion on what she cited as the ‰ÛÏbrave new world‰Ûù of opt-out actions under the Consumer Rights Act. While Pride Mobility was the first claim to be brought, it was ‰ÛÏMerricks‰Ûª attempt to do battle with MasterCard that has proved to be the blockbuster‰Ûù, she said.Giving a thorough outline of the case, Edwards then turned to Quinn Emanuel‰Ûªs Boris Bronfentrinker, who represents Merricks.The CAT had refused to certify the collective proceedings order (CPO), and later denied permission to appeal on jurisdictional grounds that because it had not certified the claim, no ‰Û÷decision‰Ûª had been issued, and therefore there was no right of appeal in accordance with the CAT‰Ûªs guidance. An application for judicial review was filed in the Administrative Court and another for permission to appeal was filed at the Court of Appeal. Permission to appeal was granted and a hearing, in tandem with a judicial review application, is set for October this year.Edward‰Ûªs pointed to the CAT‰Ûªs expression that it did not need to conduct a ‰ÛÏmini trial‰Ûù at the CPO stage, but on the other hand it said the threshold to be crossed at the CPO stage is higher than that of a strikeout application. She then turned to fellow panel member Chris Owen of Simmons & Simmons who explained how the CAT handled expert evidence.The CAT, said Owen, decided that the relevant test to apply was that in Pro-Sys v Microsoft in Canada, which had held that expert methodology must be sufficiently credible or plausible to establish some basis in fact for the commonality requirement, ‰ÛÏand that means the methodology must offer a realistic prospect of establishing loss on a class-wide basis‰Ûù, and cannot be theoretical or hypothetical, but grounded on the facts of the case and there must be some evidence on the data available to which the methodology is applied. It was not surprising that the CAT adopted the Pro-Sys approach, he added, ‰ÛÏbut how much expert evidence did the CAT require?‰ÛùAs it turned out, the CAT was quite critical of the experts, Owen stated. It questioned them for a significant part of the hearing and then it scrutinised the information given by the two experts, saying the information that had presented at hearing had been significantly more sophisticated than that in the written report.It was difficult, said Bronfentrinker, to rely on the CAT‰Ûªs guidance on experts, as while the CAT says that an expert report is not at all mandatory at the CPO request stage, ‰ÛÏit‰Ûªs impossible to get a CPO granted without an expert report‰Ûù.The CAT had required damages analysis, which was pre-disclosure and subject to obvious budgetary constraints, he said. ‰ÛÏThat is not what the CAT guidance says and that is where a lot of the issues arose in this case, and this is what we believe the Court of Appeal needs to address and hopefully correct.‰ÛùBringing a case like this is expensive and because of the amount of damages potentially at stake, it merited a significant investment by a third-party funder to proceed with a CPO.‰ÛÏI think it‰Ûªs fair to say that to do a damages analysis of the kind the CAT requires, would require significantly more expenditure on experts, including the gathering of data which is not readily available,‰Ûù Bronfentrinker said.With the only two claims brought under the new regime having failed, there was a lot of uncertainty around the tests applied by the CAT. While he agreed that Pro-Sys was the correct test to apply: ‰ÛÏIf the CAT adopts a foreign law test, like it did in MasterCard, then it must also take into account how the law has developed in that relevant jurisdiction,‰Ûù said Bronfentrinker.It had chosen a Canadian test, but it had failed to consider important Canadian precedent, through which, in his opinion, a Canadian court would not have taken the same approach: ‰ÛÏNo Canadian court would have applied the test in the way the CAT has. The CAT has set the test too high.‰ÛùTo him, the CPO became not just a mini-trial, it became nearly a full trial. ‰ÛÏIn order to meet the CPO standard that the CAT has set in the [MasterCard] judgment, you essentially do need to come forward and be ready to fight a case for three days, which is effectively at the same level and to the same extent as you would a full trial,‰Ûù Bronfentrinker stated.For his part, he concluded: ‰ÛÏIf the CAT‰Ûªs judgment is upheld, it will be difficult for large-scale consumer opt-out actions to proceed, which is contrary to the legislative intent,‰Ûù adding that he is hopeful that a different constitutional court will see these key policy issues.Summing up on what this all means for the future of collective redress in the UK, and in particular for indirect purchasers, Edwards closed with a question: ‰ÛÏAre these claims in fact an exercise in impossibility [as the defence had contended], and if it is an impossibility, is it the impossibility of calculating compensatory damages which is the issue which should prevent the claim going forward, or actually is it the impossibility of people bringing individual claims that should drive the conclusion of whether or not to grant a CPO?‰Ûù","While Pride Mobility was the first claim to be brought, it was ‰ÛÏMerricks‰Ûª attempt to do battle with MasterCard that has proved to be the blockbuster‰Ûù, she said.Giving a thorough outline of the case, Edwards then turned to Quinn Emanuel‰Ûªs Boris Bronfentrinker, who represents Merricks.An application for judicial review was filed in the Administrative Court and another for permission to appeal was filed at the Court of Appeal.She then turned to fellow panel member Chris Owen of Simmons & Simmons who explained how the CAT handled expert evidence.The CAT has set the test too high.‰ÛùTo him, the CPO became not just a mini-trial, it became nearly a full trial.","['impossible', 'cat', 'deciphering', 'appeal', 'expert', 'court', 'claim', 'case', 'cats', 'cpo', 'test', 'mastercard']",,,['Angela Bilbow'],,https://www.cdr-news.com/categories/disputes/8212-mastercard-deciphering-the-impossible,,,,

Mastercard spotlights aspiring musicians in Grammys push,"Dive Brief:Mastercard announced that it's expanding a multichannel #StartSomethingPriceless brand campaign launched earlier this month with curated content and a music-inspired pop-up event in New York City ahead of the 60th Grammy Awards on Jan. 29, according to a news release. The new push centers on a music video featuring six aspiring musicians who join five-time Grammy nominee SZA in a cover of the Willie Dixon song ""You Can't Judge a Book by the Cover.""The campaign includes videos where each of the musicians shares their story. The brand's Mastercard House retail store and concert space will additionally be open daily with curated vinyl listening stations, a photo gallery from well-known music photographers and a recording booth where visitors can press their own vinyl. The pop-up will host conversations with music industry influencers and nightly concerts.Mastercard launched #StartSomethingPriceless earlier this month. The brand is encouraging people to use the campaign hashtag to share ""their pledges to pursue a passion or purpose, effect change and lift one another up,"" a news release said.Dive Insight:Mastercard blends a number of hot marketing trends for its Grammys push, including experiential out-of-home activations like vinyl pressing stations and tapping both rising music influencers and more established talent like SZA. Working with the five-time Grammy nominee on a music video might lend the campaign more credibility with listeners and raise awareness for some of the lesser-known artists featured on the song. Brands sponsoring music events and concerts is nothing new, but actually creating branded music videos ‰ÛÓ often covering well-known songs ‰ÛÓ has become a bigger trend of late with recent efforts by companies as diverse as the Gap and Frito-Lay's Cheetos.#StartSomethingPriceless aims to refresh Mastercard's 20-year-old ""Priceless"" platform by focusing on real-life stories about people and their passions. Inspiring or cause-driven brand messaging that tackles these topics can resonate more with consumers at a time when emotional connection in marketing is in high demand, especially among younger age segments like millennials and Gen Z. Procter & Gamble is another company taking this approach with brands like Always and Herbal Essences. P&G's Head & Shoulders last week introduced a Winter Olympics push featuring a content series around U.S. Olympic freeskier Gus Kenworthy and his experience coming out as an openly-gay athlete.For last year's Grammy Awards, Mastercard set up an experiential record store and interactive music experience for fans. Users of Masterpass, its digital payment platform, were given exclusive access to vinyl purchases and performances, and each time an award was presented at the show or an artist thanked fans, Masterpass users received a special offer.","The new push centers on a music video featuring six aspiring musicians who join five-time Grammy nominee SZA in a cover of the Willie Dixon song ""You Can't Judge a Book by the Cover.""The campaign includes videos where each of the musicians shares their story.The brand's Mastercard House retail store and concert space will additionally be open daily with curated vinyl listening stations, a photo gallery from well-known music photographers and a recording booth where visitors can press their own vinyl.Working with the five-time Grammy nominee on a music video might lend the campaign more credibility with listeners and raise awareness for some of the lesser-known artists featured on the song.For last year's Grammy Awards, Mastercard set up an experiential record store and interactive music experience for fans.","['musicians', 'campaign', 'wellknown', 'vinyl', 'video', 'grammys', 'brand', 'spotlights', 'brands', 'music', 'push', 'grammy', 'videos', 'mastercard', 'aspiring']",,,"['Erica Sweeney', 'Share It']",1/24/18 8:00,https://www.marketingdive.com/news/mastercard-spotlights-aspiring-musicians-in-grammys-push/515432/,,,,

RuPay set to emerge No 2 card in volume and value of deals,"NEW DELHI: India‰Ûªs indigenous RuPay cards will pip one of the two top international card giants, Visa and Mastercard, on the value and volume of transactions done through them in the country this calendar year, a top official has said.Also, some 30 countries have approached India for the technology of ‰Û÷BHIM UPI‰Ûª platform for digital payments launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi about 16 months ago, Dilip Asbe, chief executive at National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), told the country‰Ûªs top bureaucrats at a meeting last week.‰ÛÏWe (RuPay cards) are already the number 1 scheme in the number of cards issued.

We have to ensure our instruments are enabled on websites,‰Ûù Sawhney said.Prime Minister Narendra Modi at Delhi Economics Conclave in 2015 had spoken about emergence of RuPay cards as an alternative to the otherwise duopolistic industry dominated by Visa and Mastercard. ‰ÛÏThanks to RuPay cards, we introduced healthy competition in the debit and credit card space traditionally dominated by a few international players,‰Ûù Modi had said.His government prescribed the issuance of RuPay cards to each of the account holders who have opened the accounts under the Prime Minister Jan Dhan Yojana launched in 2014.At the April 20 session, Asbe also said at least 30 countries have approached NPCI asking ‰ÛÏif you can give us IP‰Ûù of the BHIM UPI platform launched by the prime minister on December 30, 2016. ‰ÛÏAll our life we have been following the west.

Mastercard Launches Assemble for Millennials,"‰ÛÏAvengers, assemble!‰Ûù is a rally cry that would perk the ears of many millennials, but how about ‰ÛÏMastercard, assemble?‰ÛùThe card network is hoping that‰Ûªs the case, as it rolls out the first use case stemming from its recently launched global prepaid money management platform. Assemble for millennials is a toolkit that issuers, corporations and IBCUs can use to enable digital financial solutions, in this case targeting millennials, using a single-access digital prepaid product. Those physical and virtual prepaid products can be used to pay online and at stores, anywhere Mastercard is accepted.Though there will be other use cases down the road, Mastercard‰Ûªs head of prepaid and inclusive growth for North America markets, Solana Cozzo, said in a recent interview with Karen Webster that the company wanted to start with millennials since this demographic does not have an easy on-ramp into the financial mainstream.Rather, Cozzo said, Mastercard‰Ûªs research shows they are cobbling together a financial management system across many different platforms and apps. Millennials, she stated, may use their bank‰Ûªs app to view balances, another app to pay bills, a third for peer-to-peer transfers (such as paying back friends and family members) and a fourth to manage their budget and/or save for a significant purchase, such as a gift, vacation or home.With Assemble, Mastercard aims to give issuers a set of tools that will help them, well, assemble all of those functions into a single place, so that these account holders have a single view into their finances ‰ÛÒ with the goal of making prudent spending and saving decisions based on actual account data.So, why prepaid and not debit? And why a payment card at all, when banking services are overwhelmingly shifting to digital, and when the digital-first generation is the product‰Ûªs prime target?Cozzo and Webster discussed how the prepaid element fits into Mastercard‰Ûªs digital strategy, and how it answers millennials‰Ûª top three priorities.What Millennials WantCozzo said that Mastercard has learned there are three main things that any solution targeting millennials must deliver.First, it must be simple: Millennials crave simplicity. Cozzo said they‰Ûªre tired of piecing together a financial management system across different platforms and apps. Millennials want an experience that is not fragmented, but rather a single hub where they can see and manage all the elements of their financial lives.Second, it must put millennials in control of their money. Millennials don‰Ûªt like being told what to do, said Cozzo ‰ÛÒ rather, they want to be empowered to make their own informed decisions about their financial lives, and that requires giving them access to the right data.Third, it must be secure: Millennials want to know their accounts are safe. Like most consumers today, they are highly aware of the security threats that could put their hard-earned, thinly-stretched earnings at risk, and they want no part of it. Anyone they entrust with their money had better guard it with their lives. There is also a lock function that customers can enact to stop payments and avoid unauthorized spending. Other standard Mastercard security features have been incorporated into the solution, as well.For Mastercard, Cozzo said that the product of this equation was a mobile app and corresponding website where account holders can view balances, access budgeting tools, manage and pay their bills, send P2P payments, set savings goals and receive direct deposits from their employers. Cozzo said the P2P aspect works for almost anyone in the U.S. with a valid debit card via Mastercard Send‰Ûªs P2P service. It delivers payments in near-real time, addressing a growing expectation among today‰Ûªs consumers that money sent must be sent and received in an instant.The product is also designed to help millennials save. Once payments and savings contributions have been met, the product can calculate the amount of flexible funds available so that customers know their budget for extras like entertainment and dining out that month. They can then place all or part of that ‰ÛÏfree cash‰Ûù onto their prepaid card and spend with the confidence that they‰Ûªre not dipping into funds they should have been using elsewhere.The Pros Of PrepaidPrepaid, said Cozzo, goes beyond a payment card. For Mastercard, it‰Ûªs a platform for innovation that allows the company to create new possibilities across stakeholders. And although the Assemble product was viewed as an initial entry point into the financial mainstream, millennials aren‰Ûªt the only ones who showed interest during the product‰Ûªs pilot phase, said Cozzo. Mastercard has seen use cases in which the product has created easy access to financial services for those who have previously been excluded from the formal economy.Recalling a childhood of sorting cash into envelopes for different purposes, Cozzo said that it‰Ûªs also possible that cardholders may simply value the ability to isolate funds to ensure that they aren‰Ûªt cutting into their ability to keep up with rent, mortgages, car payments and other bills.‰ÛÏWhether prepaid is for FinTechs and startups or creating the next big thing in payments, to large corporations and governments looking to create operational efficiencies, prepaid has been an excellent engine to assist in the distribution of key disbursements in an efficient and transparent way,‰Ûù Cozzo said.Webster noted that it could also be valuable for bringing new customers into the fold, so that the financial institution can pitch other products and services in the future.In Action‰ÛÏAssemble,‰Ûù Cozzo explained, is the B2B name for the platform. Mastercard customers who choose to implement the white-label product will do so with their own branding, whether they opt to deploy the full solution or cherry-pick the elements they wish to use via APIs.That way, she said, customers who are trying to enable digital solutions can get to market faster. According to a press release by the company, ‰ÛÏMastercard Assemble not only bundles assets and services together, but also enables these digital prepaid solutions to promote innovation, increase the speed to market and provide customers with seamless and secure usage.‰ÛùCozzo said that Mastercard has been piloting the Assemble platform and plans to begin working with issuers to make it available to millennial end users in the new year, with ‰ÛÏAssemble for gig workers‰Ûù and other use cases soon to follow.","Assemble for millennials is a toolkit that issuers, corporations and IBCUs can use to enable digital financial solutions, in this case targeting millennials, using a single-access digital prepaid product.With Assemble, Mastercard aims to give issuers a set of tools that will help them, well, assemble all of those functions into a single place, so that these account holders have a single view into their finances ‰ÛÒ with the goal of making prudent spending and saving decisions based on actual account data.Cozzo and Webster discussed how the prepaid element fits into Mastercard‰Ûªs digital strategy, and how it answers millennials‰Ûª top three priorities.What Millennials WantCozzo said that Mastercard has learned there are three main things that any solution targeting millennials must deliver.And although the Assemble product was viewed as an initial entry point into the financial mainstream, millennials aren‰Ûªt the only ones who showed interest during the product‰Ûªs pilot phase, said Cozzo.","['prepaid', 'product', 'digital', 'cozzo', 'customers', 'financial', 'payments', 'launches', 'millennials', 'mastercard', 'assemble']",,,[],2017-12-15 04:01:18+00:00,https://www.pymnts.com/news/digital-banking/2017/mastercard-assemble-millennials-solana-cozzo-prepaid-cards/,,,,

MasterCard will finally stop forcing people to sign receipts,"""Can I get you to sign on the bottom?"" ""Your signature, please?"" ""Sign here.""Those prompts that you've heard forever after shopping, eating out, and spending money are coming to an end.MasterCard is doing away with signatures on purchases starting in April.It's the end of an era. The future signature-less payment process stemmed from company research showing that customers wanted to speed up time at the register.Requiring a signature had become antiquated with so many other security features such as chips, biometrics, and digital payment platforms. Some new MasterCard credit cards have a fingerprint sensor embedded in the card. When paying, cardholders just touch the sensor while holding the card as they dip it into the terminal.Already 80 percent of debit and credit card transactions with a MasterCard in the U.S. and Canada don't require a signature, but soon it'll be all of them.Nobody seems too upset about the loss.#AboutTime MasterCard has finally realized that signatures are obsolete and stupid https://t.co/RmpVU8lDBg ‰ÛÓ Stephen diFilipo (@S_dF) October 20, 2017Basically, this is all to make it easier to spend your money.

How Is Mastercard Growing So Fast?,"Mastercard (NYSE:MA) has done an amazing job lately in making the most of the huge opportunities in the global payments industry. Even though its primary rival remains larger, Mastercard has been taking big strides toward closing the gap. Those following the stock have to be impressed with the progress Mastercard has made in producing the levels of growth necessary to try to catch up to its archnemesis.Coming into Wednesday's first-quarter financial report, Mastercard investors fully expected that the company would be able to keep growing at a healthy rate. Yet nearly no one anticipated just how strong those growth figures would be, and Mastercard's international exposure helped play a major role in boosting the company's revenue and earnings to start 2018.With favorable conditions likely to continue, many are optimistic about Mastercard's capacity to sustain its growth rates well into the future.A big boost for MastercardMastercard's first-quarter results were simply phenomenal. Revenue soared 31%, to $3.58 billion, topping the consensus forecast for the top line by fully $330 million. Net income grew even more sharply, rising 38%, to $1.49 billion, and the resulting earnings of $1.41 per share compared quite favorably to the $1.25 per share that those following the stock were expecting to see.Mastercard kept firing on all cylinders from a fundamental perspective. Gross dollar volume soared 19%, to $1.42 billion, accelerating in its pace of growth from previous quarters. Switched transaction counts came in at 16.7 billion, sustaining their past growth rate of 17% after adjusting for the deconsolidation of Mastercard's business in Venezuela.Cross-border volumes measured in local currency jumped 21%, and favorable currency impacts across the company's network lifted overall revenue by about 4 percentage points. Overall card counts remained at roughly 2.4 billion.There were a couple of concerns about Mastercard on the expense side of the income statement. Adjusted operating expenses rose 35%, outpacing revenue growth and causing operating margin to fall more than a percentage point, to 54.2%. Higher litigation provisions and general increases in overhead expenses were largely responsible for the increase.Yet $100 million of the figure came from the company's contribution to its Mastercard Center for Inclusive Growth charitable organization. Moreover, with a 9 percentage point drop in income tax rates, Mastercard once again got a huge boost from tax reform, paying $86 million less in taxes despite the much higher pre-tax income.Mastercard's international business keeps paying off for the company. Gross dollar volume was higher by 28% overseas compared to a 12% rise in the U.S. market. Although currency impacts played a huge role in international outperformance, volumes were higher by 20%, even when measured in local currencies. Similar disparities in purchase volume and cash transactions make it clear that Mastercard's future depends on continued penetration into the global markets.What's next for Mastercard?CEO Ajay Banga summed up Mastercard's strategy quite succinctly. ""We are investing in areas such as safety and security and our digital solutions to drive long-term growth,"" Banga said, ""with a focus on delivering simple and secure transactions across all channels."" The CEO pointed to record revenue and earnings for the quarter as evidence of solid execution.The pace of stock buybacks at Mastercard also emphasized the commitment that the payments giant has in returning capital to shareholders. Mastercard bought back 7.9 million shares during the quarter, spending $1.4 billion in the process. Just in the first month of the second quarter, the card giant added another 3.5 million shares of buybacks, spending more than $600 million and leaving the company with about $3.3 billion left in authorized repurchase capacity.Global economic conditions have been quite strong, and the weakening of the U.S. dollar could be a tailwind to growth for Mastercard well into the future. In the long run, currency fluctuations might well cancel each other out, but the company's emphasis on tapping into emerging markets where electronic payment transactions are only in their infancy could pay big dividends in future years.Mastercard investors liked what they saw, and the stock rose 4% in pre-market trading following the announcement. Growth rates like what the company saw this quarter won't happen every time, but overall, Mastercard is on the right path to sustain impressive growth for the foreseeable future.","Coming into Wednesday's first-quarter financial report, Mastercard investors fully expected that the company would be able to keep growing at a healthy rate.Adjusted operating expenses rose 35%, outpacing revenue growth and causing operating margin to fall more than a percentage point, to 54.2%.Yet $100 million of the figure came from the company's contribution to its Mastercard Center for Inclusive Growth charitable organization.Similar disparities in purchase volume and cash transactions make it clear that Mastercard's future depends on continued penetration into the global markets.The pace of stock buybacks at Mastercard also emphasized the commitment that the payments giant has in returning capital to shareholders.","['stock', 'million', 'fast', 'higher', 'future', 'billion', 'mastercards', 'quarter', 'growth', 'revenue', 'growing', 'mastercard']",,,"['Dan Caplinger', ""Dan Caplinger Has Been A Contract Writer For The Motley Fool Since As The Fool'S Director Of Investment Planning"", 'Dan Oversees Much Of The Personal-Finance', 'Investment-Planning Content Published Daily On Fool.Com.

"Visa, Mastercard Enjoy the Holidays as Customer Spending Climbs","Visa Inc. and Mastercard Inc. are still enjoying some holiday cheer.The companies posted profit and revenue in the three months ended Dec. 31 that beat analysts‰Ûª estimates and boosted their 2018 earnings forecasts. A robust holiday season and increased gas prices spurred customer purchases on the firms‰Ûª networks in the quarter, with spending on Visa increasing 10 percent and 13 percent on Mastercard.Season of Cheer Holiday spending on Visa and Mastercard's networks helped boost their revenue Source: Bloomberg data‰ÛÏMomentum accelerated in the U.S. driven by strong holiday spending and e-commerce growth,‰Ûù Visa Chief Executive Officer Al Kelly said in a statement.Mastercard shares rose 2.3 percent to a record $172.93 in New York, extending this year‰Ûªs gain to 14 percent.

Purchases, which account for about 70 percent of the economy, climbed 0.4 percent after a revised 0.8 percent advance a month earlier, according to Commerce Department figures released Jan. 29. The season‰Ûªs tally should reach $671 billion, a ‰ÛÏstellar‰Ûù 5.5 percent increase from last year, according to Craig Johnson, head of research firm Customer Growth Partners.Mastercard took a $981 million charge in the fourth quarter largely tied to changes in U.S. tax laws, but should benefit longer-term from the reduction in the corporate rate. Chief Financial Officer Martina Hund-Mejean said the company expects a rate of 20 percent in 2018.Forecasts RaisedMastercard‰Ûªs growth in adjusted net revenue should be in the ‰ÛÏmid-teens"" this year, compared with the 12.5 percent analysts in a Bloomberg survey forecast, the Purchase, New York-based firm said in a statement. It also raised its 2016 to 2018 forecast for earnings growth per share from about 20 percent to ‰ÛÏmid-20s.""Visa raised its full-year forecast for adjusted EPS growth to the ""mid-20s"" from the ""mid-teens"" it previously expected. The firm said its effective tax rate for the year will be about 23 percent, according to a regulatory filing. It also increased its quarterly dividend 7.7 percent to 21 cents a share, and authorized a new $7.5 billion share repurchase program.So far in 2018, Mastercard is seeing a boost to cross-border volumes -- a measure of spending abroad -- from an unlikely source: cardholders buying cryptocurrencies, Hund-Mejean said on a call with analysts.Here are some highlights from Mastercard‰Ûªs and Visa‰Ûªs quarter:","Visa Inc. and Mastercard Inc. are still enjoying some holiday cheer.A robust holiday season and increased gas prices spurred customer purchases on the firms‰Ûª networks in the quarter, with spending on Visa increasing 10 percent and 13 percent on Mastercard.Season of Cheer Holiday spending on Visa and Mastercard's networks helped boost their revenue Source: Bloomberg data‰ÛÏMomentum accelerated in the U.S. driven by strong holiday spending and e-commerce growth,‰Ûù Visa Chief Executive Officer Al Kelly said in a statement.U.S. consumer spending rose at a solid pace in December as shoppers splurged during the holidays.Visa raised its full-year forecast for adjusted EPS growth to the ""mid-20s"" from the ""mid-teens"" it previously expected.","['customer', 'visa', 'holidays', 'enjoy', 'holiday', 'rate', 'forecast', 'spending', 'climbs', 'share', 'quarter', 'growth', 'firm', 'revenue', 'mastercard']",,,['Jennifer Surane'],2/1/18 0:00,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-02-01/mastercard-rises-as-customer-spending-surges-13-during-holidays,,,,
"Mastercard, MegaFon Partner On Mobile Payments","Mastercard and MegaFon have introduced two joint initiatives that will allow subscribers to link their mobile phone accounts to Apple Pay or Samsung Pay through the creation of a virtual Mastercard card.The partnership, which was announced at Mobile World Congress 2018 in Barcelona, will enable MegaFon‰Ûªs subscribers to pay for purchases with their smartphones by linking their mobile accounts to Apple Pay or Samsung Pay through a virtual Mastercard card, tokenizing it via the Mastercard platform.The service will be available starting March 1. The only restriction: The maximum amount that may be debited from an account amounts to RUB 100,000 per month.‰ÛÏWe hope to encourage most users of Apple and Samsung devices in our network to subscribe to this service. This will considerably increase the penetration of cashless payment services in Russia. This unique project will offer new opportunities to our subscribers in Russia and will serve as a precedent in global practice. I believe that it will not only make new payment technologies more accessible but will also open up new avenues for telecommunications companies in the sphere of financial services,‰Ûù said Yan Kukhalsky, MegaFon‰Ûªs director of New Businesses and Partnerships.In addition, the partnership also allows subscribers to create a virtual Mastercard bank card via the MegaFon.Bank app. After the card is linked to the Apple Pay, Android Pay or Samsung Pay service, it can be used to make both online and offline purchases. Customers will also receive 20 percent cash back for every third purchase they make with the app.Each user can create up to 10 virtual cards linked to one mobile phone account, handing them out to family members while also monitoring their spending through the account.Payments made with a virtual card utilize Mastercard‰Ûªs tokenization technology, which replaces the number on a customer‰Ûªs card with a unique, generated code.‰ÛÏMegaFon and Mastercard enjoy a longstanding cooperation, which started when the mobile network operator launched its own Mastercard bank card. We have now made a new digital step toward the future together: When developing new products, we are guided by the principle that any device connected to the internet can become a simple, secure and convenient payment tool,‰Ûù said Mikhail Fedoseev, director of Business Development and Digital Payments of Mastercard in Russia, Belarus, Armenia and Kazakhstan.","Mastercard and MegaFon have introduced two joint initiatives that will allow subscribers to link their mobile phone accounts to Apple Pay or Samsung Pay through the creation of a virtual Mastercard card.The partnership, which was announced at Mobile World Congress 2018 in Barcelona, will enable MegaFon‰Ûªs subscribers to pay for purchases with their smartphones by linking their mobile accounts to Apple Pay or Samsung Pay through a virtual Mastercard card, tokenizing it via the Mastercard platform.In addition, the partnership also allows subscribers to create a virtual Mastercard bank card via the MegaFon.Bank app.Payments made with a virtual card utilize Mastercard‰Ûªs tokenization technology, which replaces the number on a customer‰Ûªs card with a unique, generated code.‰ÛÏMegaFon and Mastercard enjoy a longstanding cooperation, which started when the mobile network operator launched its own Mastercard bank card.","['megafon', 'card', 'subscribers', 'samsung', 'partner', 'pay', 'payments', 'apple', 'virtual', 'mobile', 'russia', 'mastercard', 'service']",,,[],2018-02-28 14:15:50+00:00,https://www.pymnts.com/mastercard/2018/mastercard-megafon-mobile-payments/,,,,
Litecoin (LTC) & Litepay Need Government Backing To Work With MasterCard,"Litecoin‰Ûªs (LTC) Litepay was meant to be released on 26th February in an event that was dubbed as revolutionary and bridging the gap between cryptocurrency and regular day to day spending in a normal fiat economy. A fiat economy is one that is backed by the respective central bank of the issuing country. Examples of fiat currency are the United States Dollar, The Indian Rupee, European Union Euro and South African Rand. Litepay was meant to bridge the gap between cryptocurrencies ‰ÛÒ using Litecoin as the base crypto in the platform ‰ÛÒ and the fiat currencies mentioned above and the many more available around the globe.The anticipation of the release had propelled Litecoin (LTC) to levels of $233 on the scheduled day of release. However, the team at Litepay and Litecoin (LTC) sent out an email notifying preregistered users of the platform, that release was going to be postponed indefinitely. It was later revealed that the Litecoin team was having a hard time finding a payment card provider that was lenient towards cryptocurrencies. Such card payment service providers include the famous VISA and MasterCard.Since the indefinite postponement of the Litepay launch, the value of Litecoin has dropped 33.4% from the peak value that February morning of $233 to a current trading value of $155 at the moment of writing this.In the case of Litepay lacking a payment card provider who would back their platform, Mastercard has come out openly and declared, through a statement, that it will only support State Issued cryptocurrencies and none of the current crypto in the market that support anonymity by abiding by the Satoshi principle of decentralization.Mastercards idea is for using central bank issued cryptocurrencies in the future. This means that the only coin that can qualify to be used on their card services, is Venezuela‰Ûªs and President Nicolas Maduro‰Ûªs Petro. The partnership between the Petro and Mastercard is highly unlikely due to current political tensions between Venezuela and the United States. This is because Mastercard is a company that has been incorporated in the United States. I am sure the US Government will have something to say about any attempts of a partnership between the two.Perhaps one way of Litepay to get around the stiff Mastercard requirement, is the endorsement of Litecoin (LTC) by a very liberal American State such as California or Washington (Seattle). The United States constitution allows for States in the Union to make their own laws. Perhaps it is time for California or Washington to embrace Litecoin as an alternative to the dollar. I doubt this will cause the Federal government to send in the National Guard for there is no legislation for Cryptocurrencies in the current American Constitution. This is a loophole that can be explore. Or if you want to use computer programming terms, this is is a bug in the American Constitution. (Please note I am not a lawyer.)It is also highly unlikely for Mastercard to partner with any current cryptocurrencies due to the fact that the card payment service provider, recently filed a patent for instantaneous payments using blockchain technology. This does not necessarily mean that Mastercard wants to issue its own ICO. This means that the back end settlement software they want to implement, will be on their blockchain.Mastercard‰Ûªs instantaneous payment settlement idea is not that much different to products already available through the Ripple Network. Ripple has three such solutions: xCurrent, xRapid and xVia.In conclusion, Litepay has two options moving forward. The first, is to get the backing of a government somewhere in the world. One option would be to explore options such as Vanuatu, Panama or even the Autonomous territory of China known as Macau. Another option for Litepay is to completely forget Mastercard and go back to the drawing board and design a platform similar to that being offered by Crypterium. A partnership between the two projects ‰ÛÒ Crypterium and Litepay ‰ÛÒ would be a perfect solution that would show Mastercard and Visa that they are not the ‰Û÷prettiest girls at the party‰Ûª.[Photo source, youtube.com]Follow us on Telegram","Examples of fiat currency are the United States Dollar, The Indian Rupee, European Union Euro and South African Rand.However, the team at Litepay and Litecoin (LTC) sent out an email notifying preregistered users of the platform, that release was going to be postponed indefinitely.It was later revealed that the Litecoin team was having a hard time finding a payment card provider that was lenient towards cryptocurrencies.The partnership between the Petro and Mastercard is highly unlikely due to current political tensions between Venezuela and the United States.The United States constitution allows for States in the Union to make their own laws.","['ltc', 'need', 'card', 'current', 'united', 'backing', 'litecoin', 'work', 'states', 'cryptocurrencies', 'litepay', 'mastercard', 'platform', 'payment']",,,"['John P.

McCann London Taps Into Healing Power of Music For Mastercard,"McCann London launches its latest creative for Mastercard--the headline sponsor of The BRIT Awards 2018 honoring the best in U.K. music. The campaign ‰ÛÏStart Something Priceless‰Ûù highlights the important role music can play in people‰Ûªs lives.After many years of successful Priceless Surprises in Music at The BRIT Awards, Mastercard uses this year‰Ûªs sponsorship to launch its new global brand platform ‰Û÷Start Something Priceless‰Ûª in the UK where they move from observing Priceless moments, to empowering people to create them. As such, McCann collaborated with award-winning composer and 2012 Olympic music director, David Arnold, and 24-piece orchestra to create a piece of music that could break down the walls between people and bring them together.People were sought out, whose relationships had fallen apart, some of whom had not seen or spoken to one another in years. They were then placed in a specially constructed Listening Room, designed to separate them by a single sheet of glass whilst bringing them face to face without distractions. Asked to simply sit and look at each other, the specially composed track was then played to them through headphones.Slowly but surely the emotionally driven music unraveled each couple as they quickly relinquished any feelings of resentment. The dividing plate of glass was then removed--bringing the couples back together, embracing each other and starting a conversation.Chad Warner, creative director at McCann London, said, ‰ÛÏOur aim was to give these relationships a chance to completely start again. To strip away all the junk that‰Ûªs getting in the way ‰ÛÒ pride, history, even words ‰ÛÒ and let music do its magic.‰ÛùMastercard‰Ûªs global music strategy--to demonstrate the effect music has on people physically, emotionally and culturally--underpins this activity.

Mastercard digs into the nuances of conversational commerce,"Digital assistants are increasingly commonplace, and the trend is pressuring merchants and issuers to figure out how to keep up with consumers' interest in conversational computing.""Awareness of voice tech is very high and that's going to drive new purchasing habits,"" said Kiki Del Valle, senior vice president of commerce for every device at Mastercard.Mastercard released research with Mercator late last week, assessing the growth of computerized assistants such as Apple's Siri, Microsoft's Cortana, Amazon's Alexa and Google Assistant.Mastercard has several projects underway that respond to consumer preferences to use connected devices, which impacts how consumers engage with virtual cards And it also is testing the uses and limitations of voice technology for payment execution and ID in the myriad projects underway to place Mastercard into new connected devices.While it's not unusual for a brand to release research that supports a strategic initiative, there are several takeaways that suggest voice and AI assistants bypassed the typically longer early adoption periods that the internet and smartphones had to endure. And Mastercard and Mercator's research is backed by other reports that show the quick acceptance of AI and voice among consumers.According to the recent study of 3,000 consumers conducted by Mastercard and Mercator, two-thirds of U.S. consumers use either voice assistants or messenger/text chatbots. Out of these, one in five use chat for commerce. Those who prefer voice assistants for shopping prefer its ease and speed over texting. Those who prefer chatbots cite text‰Ûªs accuracy compared to voice as well as privacy, which is why messenger bots are favored for use in the workplace, according to Mastercard and Mercator.The challenge is how AI, chat and voice change the more scripted interactions consumers have with e-commerce and online banking sites. In the past, consumers and merchants used the language of payments, credit card companies and merchants. Now consumers are more actively driving the vocabulary.""We want to know about permissions at the user level and real-time notifications,"" Del Valle said, adding permissions or IDs need to keep in mind the difference between conversational commerce and the older practice if keying in card information at a checkout page. ""People don't always know their card number, for example.""The card brand plans to expand its smartphone photo authentication system (commonly known as selfie pay) to Europe over the next year. It is also aggressively pursuing messaging projects with Facebook's chatbots to power ordering for FreshDirect, The Cheesecake Factory and other merchants. Mastercard's work with FreshDirect overlaps a project with Samsung to enable ordering and payment for web-connected refrigerators.""This will all become more conversational, and there needs to be more intelligent interfaces,"" Del Valle said. ""The consumers also need to understand the technology's limitations ‰Û_ there is still a disconnect between knowledge and general use.""While there is some pressure on merchants to develop strategies for voice and AI, the current use cases are still very basic. The most common use for voice and text-based agents are informational tasks such as internet searches, merchant inquiries, looking for gas stations, directions or commands to make calls, play music or send texts, according to Mastercard and Mercator. But 21% did say they use voice assistants and/or chatbots to shop, buy, pay bills, bank or send money.""We are seeing a shift in how consumers acquire information with voice-based search on the rise, especially among younger subsets,"" said Michelle Evans, head of consumer research for Euromonitor International. ""In time, this will likely impact how a wider part of the population prefers to research commerce decisions and execute purchases, but today it is likely limited to certain consumer subsets and specific categories where voice is advantageous over type.""That said, consumers who use connected commerce do so to save time and money, rather than avoid people or out of a general preference for electronic chat. Whether a company should invest in technology that would enable such experiences comes down understanding its specific consumer base and whether it can effectively create an experience on these platforms that would further its brand ethos, Evans said.","Mastercard released research with Mercator late last week, assessing the growth of computerized assistants such as Apple's Siri, Microsoft's Cortana, Amazon's Alexa and Google Assistant.And Mastercard and Mercator's research is backed by other reports that show the quick acceptance of AI and voice among consumers.According to the recent study of 3,000 consumers conducted by Mastercard and Mercator, two-thirds of U.S. consumers use either voice assistants or messenger/text chatbots.Those who prefer voice assistants for shopping prefer its ease and speed over texting.But 21% did say they use voice assistants and/or chatbots to shop, buy, pay bills, bank or send money.","['card', 'digs', 'commerce', 'research', 'nuances', 'voice', 'assistants', 'chatbots', 'consumer', 'consumers', 'conversational', 'mastercard', 'merchants']",,,['John Adams'],2018-01-29 00:01:36.660000-05:00,https://www.paymentssource.com/news/mastercard-digs-into-the-nuances-of-conversational-commerce,,,,
Mastercard‰Ûªs Predictive Analytics Solution Minimizes Risk for Retailers,"Risk-taking retailers can roll the dice with near certainty thanks to predictive analytics solutions that deliver crucial consumer data and insights ‰ÛÏbased in confidence.‰ÛùAnd through solutions such as Test & Learn, a program from Mastercard‰Ûªs Applied Predictive Technologies arm, advanced analytics allow brands and retailers to experiment and innovate in digital and physical spaces with mitigated risk, as well as provide ‰ÛÏexecutive-ready‰Ûù outputs that quickly and clearly articulate vital consumer insights and recommendations. Mastercard‰Ûªs Test & Learn solution caters to almost half of the top 100 retailers in the U.S.The solution‰Ûªs three-pronged approach to generating insights is a step-by-step process that begins with designing a test and selecting a representative group to partake in an experiment; measuring its impact via control group comparisons, and optimizing rollout by identifying key performance drivers and predictive modeling designed to increase profitability.Anthony Bruce, Mastercard‰Ûªs president of advanced analytics, told WWD, ‰ÛÏThe ability to accurately predict the impact of an initiative before taking on the cost and risk of rolling out an ineffective program is tremendous. Being able to measure all of the smaller decisions that can ladder-up to a bigger success means that companies working with us are able to respond rapidly and more effectively. They can rigorously design and analyze hundreds of tests, rather than a select few.‰ÛùThe company noted that consumers are keenly focused on amenities and expediencies offered by brands and retailers. ‰ÛÏOne of the trends we saw accelerate in the last year was around convenience-focused initiatives ‰ÛÓ essentially, programs or offerings that are meant to make consumers‰Ûª lives easier. With all of us pulled in a million directions, brands that make things simpler can be a real draw. We discovered this in our original State of Business Experimentation survey, which details how leading organizations are experimenting across their business to improve the customer experience. Retailers cited increased competition with companies launching convenience-oriented initiatives and predicted that competitive pressures on this front will continue to grow as consumers increasingly opt for the most frictionless, convenient shopping experiences.‰ÛùAnd, unsurprisingly, the importance of omnichannel retailing for a cohesive and immersive shopping experience can never be overstated. According to Mastercard, omnichannel strategy is especially impactful when measuring the success rates of digital advertising campaigns, ‰ÛÏas it can be challenging for organizations to attribute in-store purchases to online ad exposure,‰Ûù Bruce said. ‰ÛÏImagine a customer sees an ad for a coat online, checks it out on the web site, then waits a few days and goes into the store to try it on before purchasing. If the retailer does not have a process in place to measure the impact of digital ads across channels, the resulting sales may not be captured in the ad measurement, creating an inaccurate picture of campaign effectiveness,‰Ûù Bruce added.Bruce also said there are some occasions when retailers will introduce products through online channels before distributing them to physical stores, as retailers are looking both in-store and online to test new products to appeal to the omnichannel consumer. Bruce told WWD, ‰ÛÏShopping is personal, but retailers have to be practical. The customer has endless options and the journey reflects that. I may prefer to browse on an app but purchase in-store after trying on a new shirt, whereas my wife may browse and buy online. It is important that retailers evaluate new programs with a cross-channel lens to understand their true overall impact on the bottom line.‰ÛùFor More Textiles News From WWD, See:Applied DNA Sciences to Create Anti-Counterfeiting Sewing ThreadSustainable Polymers Popularize Across Textile MarketsMerchandise Returns Accrue Waste, Strain Brands and RetailersSlow Factory Founder Discusses Sustainability, Material Science","Mastercard‰Ûªs Test & Learn solution caters to almost half of the top 100 retailers in the U.S.Anthony Bruce, Mastercard‰Ûªs president of advanced analytics, told WWD, ‰ÛÏThe ability to accurately predict the impact of an initiative before taking on the cost and risk of rolling out an ineffective program is tremendous.They can rigorously design and analyze hundreds of tests, rather than a select few.‰ÛùThe company noted that consumers are keenly focused on amenities and expediencies offered by brands and retailers.With all of us pulled in a million directions, brands that make things simpler can be a real draw.Bruce told WWD, ‰ÛÏShopping is personal, but retailers have to be practical.","['solution', 'bruce', 'impact', 'shopping', 'retailers', 'minimizes', 'risk', 'mastercards', 'analytics', 'brands', 'solutions', 'test', 'online', 'predictive', 'wwd']",,,"['Tracey Greenstein', 'Joelle Diderich', 'Jennifer Weil', 'Katya Foreman']",2018-04-26 15:51:48+00:00,http://wwd.com/business-news/technology/mastercards-predictive-analytics-solution-minimizes-risk-retailers-1202660908/,,,,

Blockchain Patent: Mastercard to develop system to Fastrack blockchain navigation,"Mastercard International Inc, one of the world‰Ûªs most popular payment platform, has applied for a patent to the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) to develop a system to make tracking the movement of information on the blockchain network through data manipulation easier. According to the information provided on the patent filing, the system aims to find a way to quickly add new nodes to a blockchain network ease data tracking.Also on the filing, the company outlines a method by which nodes can connect with and verify the contents of a particular blockchain, this will eventually facilitate quicker navigation and verification of data blocks in a blockchain. Mastercard believes that the primary reason behind the technology is to enhance the speed at which the nodes which store a copy of that network‰Ûªs transaction history can quickly be updated.The system works by assigning a header which consists of a fast track flag, fast-track reference, a timestamp and a hash value to every data on the system. Using specialized flags and hash value, the report described would allow for greater navigation speed thereby resulting in less computational resources and energy needed to verify the blocks. Mastercard says that this method will result in more efficient navigation and verification of the blockchain.This data verification system was initially filed in October 2016 in which it describes the system as a blockchain which can store ‰ÛÏthousands, millions, or even billions of transaction records over time in a vast number of different blocks.‰Ûù Owing to the immutability nature of the blockchain, each block of data has to be verified by the nodes prior to generating and adding new blocks to the blockchain.While commenting on the inefficiency of the current verification method, Mastercard disclosed that ‰ÛÏThe verification of such a large number of blocks may take a significant amount of time, during which new blocks may be added to the blockchain, further delaying the ability for the new node to participate.‰ÛùOver the years, Mastercard has pioneered many innovative payment systems to ease the way transferring of funds is conducted. This is not the first time Mastercard is looking to utilize the unique functions of the blockchain technology. Last year, Mastercard announced that it has allowed access to its blockchain API for business-to-business (B2B) transactions‰ÛÒa technology that enables faster, transparent, and cost-effective cross-border transactions.Legal Disclaimer: The content of this website (smartereum.com) is intended to convey general information only.

Does Mastercard Incorporated‰Ûªs (NYSE:MA) Stock Price Account For Its Growth?,"Looking at Mastercard Incorporated‰Ûªs (NYSE:MA) fundamentals some investors are wondering if its last closing price of $182.55 represents a good value for money for this high growth stock. Let‰Ûªs take a look at some key metrics to determine whether there‰Ûªs any value here for current and potential future investors. View our latest analysis for MastercardWhat can we expect from MA in the future?Is MA available at a good price after accounting for its growth?Mastercard‰Ûªs growth potential is very attractive. The consensus forecast from 32 analysts is extremely positive with earnings forecasted to rise significantly from today‰Ûªs level of $3.669 to $8.137 over the next three years. This indicates an estimated earnings growth rate of 23.64% per year, on average, which illustrates a highly optimistic outlook in the near term.Mastercard is trading at price-to-earnings (PE) ratio of 49.75x, this tells us the stock is overvalued compared to the US market average ratio of 18.68x , and overvalued based on current earnings compared to the it industry average of 25.38x .We understand MA seems to be overvalued based on its current earnings, compared to its industry peers. However, to be able to properly assess the value of a high-growth stock such as Mastercard, we must incorporate its earnings growth in our valuation. The PEG ratio is a great calculation to take account of growth in the stock‰Ûªs valuation. A PE ratio of 49.75x and expected year-on-year earnings growth of 23.64% give Mastercard a quite high PEG ratio of 2.1x. This means that, when we account for Mastercard‰Ûªs growth, the stock can be viewed as overvalued , based on the fundamentals.What this means for you:MA‰Ûªs current overvaluation could signal a potential selling opportunity to reduce your exposure to the stock, or it you‰Ûªre a potential investor, now may not be the right time to buy. However, basing your investment decision off one metric alone is certainly not sufficient. There are many things I have not taken into account in this article and the PEG ratio is very one-dimensional. If you have not done so already, I urge you to complete your research by taking a look at the following:Financial Health: Is MA‰Ûªs operations financially sustainable?

Mastercard Talks Security and Innovation,"In financial services today, security and innovation can work with each other, and against each other.FinServ cybersecurity is, of course, a prime target for innovation. But customers‰Ûª constant demand for cutting-edge products and services is adding to the load of already heavy security burdens. At the same time, providers must ensure a positive, consistent customer experience.Mastercard Chief Security Solutions Officer Ajay Bhalla recently explored the relationship between financial services innovation and security, telling PYMNTS how these two dynamics can complement each other while guiding the FinServ space in its journey to a better service offering.Bank customers‰Ûª needs and demands of financial service providers are growing more sophisticated and complex. What is driving this trend?According to the Digital Evolution Index, more countries in more parts of the world have robust digital ecosystems, driving demand for trusted technology. We are on track toward a world with more than 30 billion connected devices ‰ÛÒ an irreversible trend that is dramatically changing the digital economy and delivering fulfillment of the possibility that consumers have been waiting for: The ability to increase transparency, interact with brands and move faster, with less friction.For the banks and merchants serving them, the challenge is matching the great strides in connectivity with consistency of experience and security. The pace of innovation focused on consumer experience is showing no signs of slowing down. Meanwhile, criminals are increasingly using technology designed for good in a nefarious manner. Key to success in 2018 will be the adoption of a security by design approach in innovation that marries the establishment and deployment of standards with leading edge technology.With so many options available to financial service providers to implement and offer new technologies, how can they provide a consistent end-user experience while ensuring that products and services are cutting-edge?We‰Ûªre off to a great start in 2018, securing innovation through globally adopted standards like 3-D Secure 2.0 from EMVCo and ‰ÛÏPIN on Glass‰Ûù from the PCI Council. These create consistency and pave the way for banks and merchants to plug in and leverage the power of billions of connected devices to deliver greater consumer experiences, while also addressing threats from cyberattacks and hacks. Put simply: Industry standards enable trust and make it feasible to scale the use of technology.Passwords remain commonplace, despite the evolution of security technology. How can financial service providers address customer demand for authentication processes that are more secure, efficient and convenient than passwords?For consumers ‰ÛÒ some of which have up to 90 online accounts and find passwords difficult to remember ‰ÛÒ we have room to improve. For the past five years, we‰Ûªve been very focused on getting rid of passwords. Passwords are ‰ÛÏsomething you know,‰Ûù not ‰ÛÏsomething you are.‰Ûù Remembering passwords is frustrating, and only getting harder as digital activities proliferate. Identifying people by who they are makes life safer and simpler for the individual.That is the driving force behind our efforts to develop Identity Check, which uses biometric identifiers, such as fingerprint, iris, facial or voice, to verify consumers‰Ûª identities using a mobile device during online shopping and banking activities. This speeds up checkout time, improves security and reduces cart abandonment rates. Our biometric payment card, which has already been trialed with consumers, is another example of reshaping their experience. And by retaining focus on consumer-centric solutions, we are not restricted to the single biometric of any device.These technologies are on the edge of innovation, and research we conducted in partnership with the University of Oxford found that 92 percent of banking professionals want to adopt biometric technology. 2018 is the year we can scale the adoption of biometrics in payments.Artificial intelligence is another technology that‰Ûªs driving advancement of financial service cybersecurity. How will FinServ players deploy AI tools in the coming year?Artificial intelligence and machine learning are increasingly providing the means to interpret and action the complexity and scale of data to generate useful intelligence and an individualized outcome for every interaction, despite the scale/volume. For us, artificial intelligence is already embedded in our network and how we help protect our partners. The acquisition of Brighterion progressed our use of AI, enabling our network to adapt faster and deliver even greater accuracy in decisioning and managing risk.AI is increasingly being deployed to help banks and merchants look at these new data points to give people a better experience. This will continue to grow in 2018, but the shift will be focused on leveraging the Internet of Things through behavioral analytics. Our acquisition of NuData Security has improved visibility into what is happening at the device level. It allows us to assess patterns of behavior of the user, detect botnet automation and determine the reputation of the device ‰ÛÒ critical insight for merchants in optimizing the consumer experience and for issuers in determining whether to approve payment. This capability can be applied across any device in the future.What barriers will the financial services space have to overcome as it integrates and experiments with new technologies to enhance both the customer experience and security?The internet holds the promise of a bright future ahead, but between here and there is a chasm ‰ÛÒ and it‰Ûªs called insecurity. The investment in technology, such as physical biometrics, advanced behavioral analytics, risk-based authentication and artificial intelligence, will grow. It has to, in order to secure digital payments, mobile banking applications and other channels across established, challenger and FinTech sectors. Securing innovation and innovating security will help get us across the chasm and deliver greater trust in the right technologies in 2018.","In financial services today, security and innovation can work with each other, and against each other.Mastercard Chief Security Solutions Officer Ajay Bhalla recently explored the relationship between financial services innovation and security, telling PYMNTS how these two dynamics can complement each other while guiding the FinServ space in its journey to a better service offering.Bank customers‰Ûª needs and demands of financial service providers are growing more sophisticated and complex.How can financial service providers address customer demand for authentication processes that are more secure, efficient and convenient than passwords?Securing innovation and innovating security will help get us across the chasm and deliver greater trust in the right technologies in 2018.","['2018', 'digital', 'innovation', 'services', 'financial', 'technology', 'talks', 'experience', 'intelligence', 'mastercard', 'service', 'security']",,,[],2018-03-23 08:00:20+00:00,https://www.pymnts.com/news/b2b-payments/2018/mastercard-finserv-innovation-security-ai-b2b/,,,,

"Which company offers more value? Mastercard Incorporated (MA) or Plains All American Pipeline, L.P. (PAA)","The shares of Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) and Plains All American Pipeline, L.P. (NYSE:PAA) were among the active stocks of the last trading sessions. Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) soared to 0.71% closing at the price of $192.99 whereas the shares of Plains All American Pipeline, L.P. (NYSE:PAA) declined -2.07% with the decrease of -0.510000000000002 points closing at the price of $24.16. Mastercard Incorporated has currently increase 29.04% in its stock over the period of 6-months while its rival Plains All American Pipeline, L.P. added 20.26% in the previous 6-months.Now we have to analyze the facts that if the stocks were worthy off investors‰Ûª money? The facts to analyze here are risks, profitability, returns and price trends.Returns and ProfitabilityProfitability and returns are the main reason of investment, the investors are looking for profits that they get and return they should expect over the period of time.The first and foremost return that is considered while making an investment is the ROI or Return on Investment. The ROI is the ratio between the profit against the cost of investment. Currently the ROI of Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) is 44% while the ROI of Plains All American Pipeline, L.P. (NYSE:PAA) is 10.4%. Another figure that is to be considered while analyzing the profitability of a share is its EBITDA margin, MA‰Ûªs EBITDA Margin is 25.62 whereas PAA‰Ûªs is 15.01.Both the profitability ratios suggest that Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) is more suitable investment in terms of profitability and return.EPS & Surprise FactorMastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) reported $1.14/share EPS for the previous quarter where analysts were predicting an EPS to be $1.12/share Thus beating the analyst Estimates with a Surprise Factor of 1.8 Percent. While, Plains All American Pipeline, L.P. (NYSE:PAA) reported EPS of $0.25/share in the last quarter. The analysts projected EPS of $0.41/share depicting a Surprise of -39 Percent.Taking a look at Earnings per Share, Mastercard Incorporated tends to be beating the analyst estimates more than Plains All American Pipeline, L.P.. so MA is more profitable than PAA.Technical Analysis of Mastercard Incorporated & Plains All American Pipeline, L.P.Moving average convergence divergence (MACD) shows that Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) is on a PRICE RELATIVITY trend While Plains All American Pipeline, L.P. (NYSE:PAA) is on PRICE RELATIVITY trend. The trend for the past 10-days shows that the Mastercard Incorporated was in BEARISH territory and Plains All American Pipeline, L.P. was in BULLISH territory.MA‰Ûªs current statistics gauge that the stock candle is BULLISH with LOW volatility. While PAA‰Ûªs candle is BEARISH with LOW.EPS Growth Rate: MA‰Ûªs 21.48% versus PAA‰Ûªs 16.99%Another shareholder value can be analyzed through the EPS growth rate; the next 5 years EPS growth rate is predicted by the analysts after the analyzing the previous trends. The next 5 year EPS growth rate of Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) is predicted at 21.48% while Plains All American Pipeline, L.P. (NYSE:PAA) stands at 16.99%. These numbers suggest that MA is more suitable investment in terms of EPS growth rate.Financial Risk and Liquidity ConcernsThe current ratio and the debt ratio are the two ratios that show the investor how quickly the company is able to payout its debt and how quickly it can cover its obligations. The current ratio of MA stands at 1.6 while PAA is at 0.9 whereas the debt ratio of the prior is 1.13 while the debt ratio of the later is 1.12.The values of the both ratios suggest that MA is more suitable investment when the liquidity and risk is the main concern.Analyst RecommendationsWhile making an investment, another main factor to consider before investing is the analyst recommendation on the scale of 1 to 5 where 1 is strong buy, 2 is buy, 3 is hold, 4 is Sell and 5 is strong sell. Analyst recommend 1.7 for MA and 2.2 for PAA which means MA has Buy rating whereas PAA has Hold rating.Another recommendation of analyst that is to be considered worthy is the price target. The mare price or price trend does not suggest the suitability of a stock. The price target set by analyst is also to be considered while investing as it suggests to what extent the stock will rise or fall in the near future. The price target set for MA is $196.09 which is 1.58% of its current price while PAA has price target of 25.52 which is 5.33% of its current price.Valuation RatiosValuation is the process of determining the company‰Ûªs worth for an investor, the valuation ratios give an insight to that worthiness.MA currently has price to earning P/E ratio of 40.29 whereas PAA has 13.13 while the forward P/E ratio for the prior stands at 26.11 and for the later it depicts the value of 13.46.The price to Book P/B for MA is 35.54, Price to Sale is at 15.18 and for PAA these ratios stand at 2 and 0.63.","The shares of Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) and Plains All American Pipeline, L.P.

Effervescent Growth for Mastercard,"Wide-moat Mastercard (MA) reported a 49% year-over-year increase in earnings per share, helped by a lower corporate tax rate, though operating expense growth actually outpaced a 31% increase in revenue (including the effects of acquisitions and changes in accounting rules) as the company continued to aggressively invest. Adjusted revenue growth, excluding these items, was 20%. We don‰Ûªt plan to significantly change our fair value estimate. Mastercard generated just over $1 billion in cash flow from operations, returning $1.6 billion in cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and repurchases. We believe Mastercard‰Ûªs combination of high growth and minimal reinvestment needs makes it one of the most attractive financial services companies we cover but believe its prospects are currently priced into the company‰Ûªs stock.Growth continued globally, with gross dollar volumes expanding by double-digit rates in all markets, helped a bit by currency movements. Debit volume expanded faster than credit volumes. Profitable cross-border volume, which expanded at 21%, was a major contributor to revenue growth. Despite increasing competition at the margin in various local markets, we think Mastercard‰Ûªs ubiquitious international presence will be very difficult to replicate. Furthermore, the rise of e-commerce should enable even more spending across international borders, benefiting the firm.","Adjusted revenue growth, excluding these items, was 20%.Mastercard generated just over $1 billion in cash flow from operations, returning $1.6 billion in cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and repurchases.Growth continued globally, with gross dollar volumes expanding by double-digit rates in all markets, helped a bit by currency movements.Profitable cross-border volume, which expanded at 21%, was a major contributor to revenue growth.Despite increasing competition at the margin in various local markets, we think Mastercard‰Ûªs ubiquitious international presence will be very difficult to replicate.","['helped', 'increase', 'volumes', 'mastercards', 'markets', 'effervescent', 'growth', 'volume', 'revenue', 'mastercard', 'international']",,,['Jim Sinegal'],,http://www.morningstar.com/articles/863465/effervescent-growth-for-mastercard.html,,,,
MasterCard partners with Russian MNO for mobile virtual payment cards,"Feb. 28, 2018A partnership between MasterCard and Russia's MegaFon will enable the subscribers of the mobile network operator to link their mobile phone account to Apple Pay or Samsung Pay by creating a virtual MasterCard card and tokenizing it via the Mastercard platform. As a result, MegaFon's customers will be able to pay for their purchases with just a tap of their smartphone, according to a press release.After subscribers activate this service on their personal account page on MegaFon's website, it is immediately available for use. The only restriction is that the maximum amount that may be debited from an account totals 100,000 rubles (US$1,777) per month.""We hope to encourage most users of Apple and Samsung devices in our network to subscribe to this service,"" Yan Kukhalsky, MegaFon's director of new businesses and partnerships, said in the release. ""This will considerably increase the penetration of cashless payment services in Russia. This unique project will offer new opportunities to our subscribers in Russia and will serve as a precedent in global practice. I believe it will not only make new payment technologies more accessible but will also open up new avenues for telecommunications companies in the sphere of financial services.""Another project launched jointly with MasterCard enables MegaFon's subscribers to create a virtual MasterCard bank card in one click. This can be done via the MegaFon.Bank app developed by MegaLabs. After the card is linked to the Apple Pay, Android Pay or Samsung Pay service, it can be used to pay for purchases both online and offline. Customers will receive a 20 percent cashback for every third purchase. Payments are also made using the MasterCard tokenization technology.MegaFon's customers can top up the card by simply topping up their mobile phone; in addition, they can manage their account using remote services. Each user may create up to 10 virtual cards linked to one mobile phone account. The user can then give the cards to his or her family members and monitor their expenses via his or her account.MegaFon unveiled a MasterCard bank card linked to a mobile phone account in August 2016. The cards are issued by Round Bank. They are available in any outlet of the mobile network operator. By the end of 2017, over 1.2 million MegaFon cards were issued. MegaFon cards are used primarily for paying for telecommunications services (33 percent) and shopping in supermarkets (25 percent); in some regions, the top categories of expenses also include financial services.","Feb. 28, 2018A partnership between MasterCard and Russia's MegaFon will enable the subscribers of the mobile network operator to link their mobile phone account to Apple Pay or Samsung Pay by creating a virtual MasterCard card and tokenizing it via the Mastercard platform.Another project launched jointly with MasterCard enables MegaFon's subscribers to create a virtual MasterCard bank card in one click.MegaFon's customers can top up the card by simply topping up their mobile phone; in addition, they can manage their account using remote services.Each user may create up to 10 virtual cards linked to one mobile phone account.MegaFon unveiled a MasterCard bank card linked to a mobile phone account in August 2016.","['card', 'subscribers', 'mastercard', 'pay', 'russian', 'services', 'megafons', 'partners', 'virtual', 'cards', 'mobile', 'mno', 'phone', 'payment', 'account']",,,[],2018-02-28 11:00:00-05:00,https://www.mobilepaymentstoday.com/news/mastercard-partners-with-russian-mno-for-mobile-virtual-payment-cards/,,,,
Mastercard Masterpass: An Efficient Way to Shop Online,"At NerdWallet, we adhere to strict standards of editorial integrity to help you make decisions with confidence. Some of the products we feature are from our partners. Here‰Ûªs how we make moneyAs consumers do more and more shopping online and on mobile devices, many may be looking for a secure, easy way to pay. Digital wallets can make carrying a physical credit card unnecessary in stores ‰ÛÓ but they don‰Ûªt work online and on mobile. And while it‰Ûªs frustrating to enter information at each checkout, it might feel more secure than storing personal data on multiple retailers‰Ûª sites.This is how Mastercard‰Ûªs Masterpass can help. ‰ÛÏIt‰Ûªs a digital payment service, not just a digital wallet,‰Ûù says Ellen Barbara, senior vice president of digital products at Mastercard. ‰ÛÏWe‰Ûªre bringing together our partners ‰ÛÓ banks, consumers, merchants ‰ÛÓ to provide the easiest way for a consumer to complete a purchase.‰ÛùMasterpass is best when used online and via mobile, but it‰Ûªs compatible with in-store shopping as well. Here‰Ûªs how it works.How to set up MasterpassYou can sign up for Masterpass on its website. Start by entering your email address or mobile number, and then follow the prompts to create your account and password. You can add any debit or credit card ‰ÛÓ Mastercard, Visa, Discover or American Express ‰ÛÓ and the billing address. You‰Ûªll also enter at least one shipping address, but you can add as many as you want. You might be asked to verify your account via phone, online, text or an email with a verification code.You can add any debit or credit card ‰ÛÓ Mastercard, Visa, Discover or American Express.You can also sign up via your Android phone by downloading the Masterpass app or ‰ÛÓ if you have a Mastercard from a Masterpass partner bank ‰ÛÓ by downloading that bank‰Ûªs app. (There is no standalone Masterpass app for iPhone.) Follow the Masterpass app‰Ûªs prompts to create your account. You‰Ûªll be sent a verification code, and then you‰Ûªll take a photo of the card you‰Ûªre loading to create your digital wallet.‰ÛÏThe Masterpass sign-up experience is different if you have Citi, Bank of America or Capital One or other bank-delivered wallets,‰Ûù Barbara says. ‰ÛÏThe issuing banks host their own solution and determine the user experience they will provide to their customers.‰ÛùHow to use MasterpassMasterpass works differently online, at point of sale and in a retailer‰Ûªs app.Online: When you‰Ûªre shopping at an online store that accepts Masterpass, you‰Ûªll be offered it as an option when you check out. If you choose Masterpass, a login box will appear as a screen takeover. You enter your email address and password. You‰Ûªll then get a screen asking you which card and shipping address you want to use. Make those selections to finish your purchase.We let consumers choose how they want to pay. They‰Ûªre not restricted to one device. Ellen Barbara, senior vice president of digital products at MastercardIn stores: You can use Masterpass at brick-and-mortar retailers with point-of-sale devices that accept contactless payments. Open your Masterpass app and enter your passcode or, in some cases, your fingerprint. Hold your phone over the reader to make your purchase.In a retailer‰Ûªs app: Masterpass will be listed as a payment method at checkout. For example, in the case of Fandango, you select your movie tickets; choose Masterpass as your method of payment; enter your password, PIN or fingerprint; and pay.‰ÛÏWe let consumers choose how they want to pay,‰Ûù Barbara says. ‰ÛÏThey‰Ûªre not restricted to one device.‰ÛùSecurity and incentivesWithout a service like Masterpass, it‰Ûªs most convenient to store your name, address and credit card information on retailer‰Ûªs sites, but that comes with obvious security concerns. With Masterpass, your information is stored in only one place. And as with a digital wallet, when you shop in stores, you don‰Ûªt need to carry a physical credit card.‰ÛÏIn the checkout process, we take a traditional account number and tokenize it ‰ÛÓ provide a unique identifier ‰ÛÓ so that nowhere is your 16-digit number exposed to any bad people,‰Ûù Barbara says.Also, as Masterpass partners with more retailers, you might receive special bonuses, discounts or cash back. For example, you can save $20 at 1-800-Flowers when you spend $39.99 using Masterpass.The bottom lineMasterpass ‰ÛÓ like its rival Visa Checkout ‰ÛÓ hopes to make the shopping experience faster and more secure, and it‰Ûªs especially handy for shopping at online retailers and via mobile devices. But the Masterpass app‰Ûªs lack of availability on iPhone is an obstacle, and its reviews in Google Play aren‰Ûªt good, with many commenters complaining of issues with using the tap-and-pay feature. At the moment, it has a way to go to catch up with other digital wallets for purchases in stores.Have you tried Masterpass?

"Mastercard, Facebook Help Business Go Digital","Mastercard has announced that, care of Facebook Messenger, it will be able to provide small businesses in Africa and Asia with an affordable and easy on-ramp for accepting mobile payments.Announced at Mobile World Congress, the new experience will get its first road test in Nigeria, where Mastercard will pilot a new Masterpass QR bot to help business owners move beyond cash transactions to accepting QR payments.Mastercard‰Ûªs official financial services partners in the launch will be Ecobank and Zenith Bank.‰ÛÏIn line with our goal to serve 100 million Africans by the end of 2020, Ecobank is delighted to collaborate with Facebook and Mastercard to enable underserved and unbanked micro-merchants with the opportunity to open an Ecobank account almost immediately and begin to receive instant payments using Ecobank Masterpass QR on the Facebook Messenger platform. Micro-merchants in Nigeria are already benefiting from Masterpass QR and will soon be in 32 markets across Africa, enabling them to move away from cash. That is true economic empowerment,‰Ûù said Patrick Akinwuntan, Group Executive, Consumer Bank, Ecobank Group.The pilot in Nigeria is the beginning of a larger plan by the two companies to include more businesses into the digital economy.‰ÛÏOur bank is partnering with Facebook and Mastercard to introduce Masterpass QR as a means of driving financial inclusion and creating a new payment ecosystem for MSMEs and consumers,‰Ûù said Mr. Peter Amangbo, MD/CEO of Zenith Bank Plc. ‰ÛÏThis initiative will help us encourage financial inclusion within the country, in line with the strategic thrust of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN). Buyers and sellers now meet and conclude transactions in-store, online and on social media, so we are ensuring payments can also be made on these platforms via QR codes, without having to log onto other solutions or even take a break from what you are doing on Facebook.‰ÛùEach year, $301 billion in funds flow from Nigerian consumers to businesses ‰ÛÓ and 98 percent of those payments are done in cash, according to data from the Fletcher School and Mastercard Center for Inclusive Growth.‰ÛÏEvery business owner is looking for ways to increase sales and draw new customers into their stores. By offering QR-based digital payments, smaller retailers can achieve these goals and create greater customer stickiness with little to no investment beyond the phone they already have,‰Ûù said Jorn Lambert, executive vice president, Digital Channels and Regions, Mastercard. ‰ÛÏMasterpass QR opens up new commerce channels for these merchants and enables them to create auditable transaction records. These advances open doors to other financial tools and products such as loans to drive added business growth.‰ÛùThe program will work by allowing business to request to enable QR payments.

"How to Create a Campaign That Spans 2 Decades, Like Mastercard‰Ûªs ‰Û÷Priceless‰Ûª","It is the rare campaign that lasts three years. Few continue to engage and inspire audiences after 10, and even fewer have spanned two full decades. So what‰Ûªs the key to creating a sustainable, global, market-moving campaign?Getty ImagesWhen Mastercard put its account up for bid in 1997, they were committed to picking the agency whose creative idea would outperform all others. But while the ‰ÛÏPriceless‰Ûù campaign concept performed incredibly well qualitatively in focus groups around the globe, it continued to come up short against another campaign under consideration.At the time, shifting focus from the tangible to the experiences money cannot buy was bold and contrarian for the category. And we were tapping into something so subtle, no quantitative measures could reflect then. In the end, marketing wisdom prevailed. Mastercard went with its gut and chose ‰ÛÏPriceless.‰ÛùOnce you find your truth, the key is to adapt the manifestation appropriately to the current environment.When I came onboard four years ago, ‰ÛÏPriceless‰Ûù was still a strong campaign. However, the world has completely transformed since the time it was created. With digital technologies and social media, there are so many more ways to not only reach people, but, even more importantly, to engage, enable and inspire them to action. With this unprecedented opportunity, we decided to transform this now iconic advertising campaign into a more comprehensive marketing platform‰ÛÓone that went beyond celebrating moments to creating experiences. And so we began to move ‰ÛÏPriceless‰Ûù into people‰Ûªs lives.The impact has been profound, and our brand metrics continue to strengthen. When I look at this two-decade campaign, I see many lessons that can be learned, but here are my top five takeaways:Find your truthThe most compelling reason ‰ÛÏPriceless‰Ûù has endured so long is that it is tapping into a universal human truth: experiences matter more than things. This truth, in spite of tectonic changes in the consumer landscape, remains equally relevant today. Once you find your truth, the key is to adapt the manifestation appropriately to the current environment. With ‰ÛÏPriceless,‰Ûù we did not change our guiding truth. Rather, we evolved our execution, and started to enable real-life experiences for people. We refer to this as our transformation from storytelling to storymaking.Understand your brand purposeOur brand promise is to connect people to priceless possibilities. People don‰Ûªt wake up thinking about making a payment transaction, but they do get excited about going to a concert, buying the perfect holiday dress or going to dinner with family and friends. Our role in marketing is to be a force multiplier for our business and demonstrate how Mastercard can help make life experiences even more special. This has to be done in a consistent and authentic way. We do this by organizing our efforts around consumer passions including sports, music, travel and social good. This focused approach allows us to show up in areas that are important to people in a connected, authentic way.Appreciate the value in legacyMany times marketers may get bored with their campaigns. But they shouldn‰Ûªt be in a hurry to change. A campaign needs to sink into the hearts and minds of consumers to really endure. We used to have 168 marketing programs and spent money across all of them, but we recognized that our efforts would be more powerful by connecting them through a compelling set of pillars: Priceless Cities, Priceless Surprises, Priceless Causes and Priceless Specials. Today ‰ÛÏPriceless‰Ûù has run in 54 languages in 113 countries. Honing our focus has helped ensure the platform‰Ûªs longevity and success.Listen to the consumerAd blockers and ad-free subscriptions have totally changed the game for marketers. More than 600 million devices now have preinstalled ad-blocks. Netflix has over 100 million subscribers. Consumers are clearly telling marketers they want uninterrupted experiences and view advertisements as an annoyance. They are telling us with their actions by actively installing ad blockers and even paying for ad-free content. Therefore, we must find additional ways to break through. For us, it‰Ûªs delivering and enabling experiences through ‰ÛÏPriceless‰Ûù platforms, and now consumers are becoming our brand ambassadors by sharing their stories and moments over social media.Align marketing KPIs to business objectivesThere are marketing KPIs and there are business metrics. The two cannot be mutually exclusive. Marketers need to clearly connect the dots and demonstrate how campaigns are contributing to business success. By consistently demonstrating this value, we‰Ûªve been able to secure continued investment, enabling the ‰ÛÏPriceless‰Ûù platform to continue year after year. I can‰Ûªt wait to start the next 20.Raja Rajamannar (@RajaRajamannar) is the chief marketing & communications officer at Mastercard.","But while the ‰ÛÏPriceless‰Ûù campaign concept performed incredibly well qualitatively in focus groups around the globe, it continued to come up short against another campaign under consideration.When I came onboard four years ago, ‰ÛÏPriceless‰Ûù was still a strong campaign.Understand your brand purposeOur brand promise is to connect people to priceless possibilities.We used to have 168 marketing programs and spent money across all of them, but we recognized that our efforts would be more powerful by connecting them through a compelling set of pillars: Priceless Cities, Priceless Surprises, Priceless Causes and Priceless Specials.By consistently demonstrating this value, we‰Ûªve been able to secure continued investment, enabling the ‰ÛÏPriceless‰Ûù platform to continue year after year.","['marketing', 'campaign', 'business', 'social', 'truth', 'marketers', 'decades', 'brand', 'create', 'experiences', 'mastercards', 'priceless', 'mastercard', 'spans']",,,[],,http://www.adweek.com/brand-marketing/how-to-create-a-campaign-that-spans-2-decades-like-mastercards-priceless/,,,,
"After three decades of dominance, Visa and Mastercard now have a serious competitor in RuPay","The Indian card payment scheme RuPay is on its way to break the vice-like grip of international card giants Visa and Mastercard on the value and volume of transactions in the country.

Mastercard's secret to voluntary benefits engagement? 'Grassroots buzz',"WASHINGTON ‰ÛÓ When it comes to boosting employees' voluntary benefits use, word of mouth is critical, Mastercard's senior vice president for total rewards told employers at a National Business Group on Health conference April 19.Voluntary benefits, which can range from pet insurance to financial planning, are gaining traction with employers. And when they gain traction with employees, they can give employers a competitive advantage, but that's a difficult ball to get rolling.Mastercard's Christina Brenner discussed the company's adoption of a benefit that provides employees with information about medical conditions and encourages them to seek out second opinions. The benefit had the potential to cut Mastercard's costs ‰ÛÓ especially in unnecessary surgeries ‰ÛÓ and it eventually did. But how did they get it to catch on? ""It grew because there was a grassroots buzz about what we were doing,"" Brenner said.The company also employed other tactics, like sending mailers to workers' homes and posting information on employee websites, but it was the word-of-mouth praise that proved key.In another Business Health Agenda 2018 session, Jodi Fuller, VP of benefits product development and management for the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association, echoed Brenner's insight. Fuller said her company has seen great success with its telehealth offering, in large part thanks to word-of-mouth buzz. Employees mention health needs to their coworkers, who then mention this service that doesn't require them to travel to a doctor, wait for an appointment or even take time off of work.Like Mastercard, the company enjoyed some success with efforts like mailings and free gifts for enrollees, but found that the best results came when employees championed the programs to their coworkers.But how can employers give ""word of mouth"" a little push?""We plant seeds,"" Brenner told HR Dive. Mastercard knows which employees have strong networks and taps them, asking them to be champions of the offering. Those employees then make note of it in staff meetings, and comment about it on intranet blog posts.""When you plant the seeds in the right places,"" Brenner said, ""it spreads.""","WASHINGTON ‰ÛÓ When it comes to boosting employees' voluntary benefits use, word of mouth is critical, Mastercard's senior vice president for total rewards told employers at a National Business Group on Health conference April 19.Voluntary benefits, which can range from pet insurance to financial planning, are gaining traction with employers.And when they gain traction with employees, they can give employers a competitive advantage, but that's a difficult ball to get rolling.Fuller said her company has seen great success with its telehealth offering, in large part thanks to word-of-mouth buzz.""We plant seeds,"" Brenner told HR Dive.","['told', 'grassroots', 'brenner', 'voluntary', 'employers', 'health', 'word', 'company', 'wordofmouth', 'secret', 'mastercards', 'engagement', 'buzz', 'traction', 'benefits', 'employees']",,,"['Kate Tornone', 'Share It']",4/23/18 9:55,https://www.hrdive.com/news/mastercards-secret-to-voluntary-benefits-engagement-grassroots-buzz/521772/,,,,
"For Mastercard, EMV isn't the finish line; it's a baseline for innovation","There are still regions where contactless and EMV cards are slow to roll out, and Mastercard is working to bring these markets up to speed so that they are ready for future innovations.""Efforts to encourage the deployment of EMV chip have been gathering pace around the world, and the technology now accounts for more than 80% of global 'card present' transactions,"" said Ben Gilbey, senior vice president, digital payments and labs for Asia Pacific at Mastercard. ""However, there are residual customers and countries in each region that still do not support EMV.""Bloomberg NewsMastercard has set a five-year plan to address the other 20%, making ""tap and go"" contactless technology standard by 2023. Beginning later this year, the Purchase, N.Y.-based company will require a series of card and terminal upgrades across Europe, Latin America, Asia Pacific, Africa and the Middle East.The goal is to encourage ubiquity ‰ÛÓ a Mastercard payment in one country should strongly resemble that in another ‰ÛÓ and to make it easier to update payment experiences to include mobile wallets, the Internet of Things and omnichannel shopping.""[Not supporting EMV] results in fraud migration patterns and transitional arrangements which remain in place, as well as an inconsistent experience for consumers, especially when traveling abroad,"" Gilbey said.The card network currently has of 8 million contactless locations in 111 countries; Mastercard did not say how many terminals it still needs to see upgraded. Mastercard's requirements apply to all of its branded cards accepted by point of sale terminals outside of the U.S. and Canada.Mastercard has several initiatives underway to address the maturation and diversification of payments, as transactions move away from cards to mobile phones and other connected devices.These changes have created what Mastercard CEO Ajay Banga calls an ""open playing field"" in which most of the shopping and payments experiences in global markets will change entirely over the next few years‰ÛÓinviting new innovations and experiences.Among the network's initiatives is adopting more forms of authentication in Europe and deploying ""no cash"" point of sale systems at sporting events. Mastercard is working in parallel with Visa to support contactless payments on several fronts worldwide.Transportation is one of the key markets, since transitioning to an open-loop payment system from a closed-loop ticketing system enables commuters to develop new habits. For example, merchants connected to train and bus stations could accept the same cards used to pay for fares.Mastercard has been working with more than 100 cities ‰ÛÓ including London, New York, Singapore, Sydney and Mexico City ‰ÛÓ on new transit technology to enable contactless and mobile payments. In doing so, Mastercard hopes to cut operational costs, feed more digitized ""smart city"" initiatives and encourage digital payments outside of the transit systems. Having a standardized contactless interface makes it easier to deploy strategies across different cities.""A set of unified standards is important to building global ubiquity,"" said Michelle Evans, an analyst at Euromonitor International. Japan, for example, has faced hurdles in building a proximity mobile payments market because it uses an NFC system that is not compatible with other countries, she said. ""When Apple took Apple Pay to Japan, it had to deploy phones and watches with a different NFC chip.""","Bloomberg NewsMastercard has set a five-year plan to address the other 20%, making ""tap and go"" contactless technology standard by 2023.Mastercard is working in parallel with Visa to support contactless payments on several fronts worldwide.Transportation is one of the key markets, since transitioning to an open-loop payment system from a closed-loop ticketing system enables commuters to develop new habits.Mastercard has been working with more than 100 cities ‰ÛÓ including London, New York, Singapore, Sydney and Mexico City ‰ÛÓ on new transit technology to enable contactless and mobile payments.Japan, for example, has faced hurdles in building a proximity mobile payments market because it uses an NFC system that is not compatible with other countries, she said.","['innovation', 'line', 'payments', 'working', 'technology', 'system', 'finish', 'emv', 'mobile', 'cards', 'baseline', 'markets', 'contactless', 'isnt', 'mastercard', 'payment']",,,['John Adams'],2018-02-08 00:01:00.123000-05:00,https://www.paymentssource.com/news/for-mastercard-emv-isnt-the-finish-line-its-a-baseline-for-innovation,,,,
Equifax Names Ex-Mastercard CEO To Its Board,"Equifax, the credit scoring company embattled in a scandal due to its massive data breach last fall, announced on Thursday (March 22) that Robert W. Selander, the former president and chief executive officer of Mastercard, has been named to its board of directors. In a press release, Equifax said the board now consists of 12 directors, all of whom are independent.‰ÛÏBob Selander is an outstanding addition to our Board of Directors,‰Ûù said Non-Executive Chairman, Mark L.

He will provide valuable insights with respect to our global efforts to rebuild trust with our stakeholders while ensuring long-term business success.‰ÛùAccording to Equifax, Selander served as president and CEO of Mastercard from 1997 until 2010. At Mastercard, he created and structured a business where he served as president of Mastercard‰Ûªs Europe, Middle East, Africa and Canada regions until his appointment as president and CEO. Prior to Mastercard, he spent 20 years at Citibank, where he held several leadership positions, including managing parts of Citibank‰Ûªs Consumer Financial Services business in the United States, Brazil, Puerto Rico and the United Kingdom.The appointment comes as it was recently revealed that costs from the data breach at Equifax will increase by $275 million in 2018. The jump in cost suggests the breach could turn out to be the most expensive hack of a corporation ever. Citing comments the company made on a recent conference call, Reuters reported the $275 million is in addition to the $164 million in pre-tax costs it reported for the last six months of 2017.Some of the money to be spent in 2018 for the data breach includes technology and security upgrades, legal fees and free identity theft services for consumers who were impacted by the attack. At the end of 2017, the cost from the data breach stood at $439 million. Of that amount, Equifax said $125 million will be covered by an insurance policy.","In a press release, Equifax said the board now consists of 12 directors, all of whom are independent.‰ÛÏBob Selander is an outstanding addition to our Board of Directors,‰Ûù said Non-Executive Chairman, Mark L.

Mastercard and HERE Power Ride Towards a More Connected World,"Combining payments and mapping technologies to benefit enterprises, cities and people on the moveLAS VEGAS - January 9, 2018 - Mastercard and HERE Technologies today announced an agreement to jointly create more connected experiences for people on the move.

By combining our expertise and our reach, Mastercard and HERE Technologies have the opportunity to empower mobile lifestyles in the most secure, informed and inclusive way.""Besides further advancing connected vehicle payments, additional use cases that may be explored include mobility-as-a-service (MaaS), demand management and location-based offerings. Solutions for these use cases will aim to leverage data analytics capabilities from both companies, including HERE's Open Location Platform. Whether mobility and logistics providers, cities and tourism authorities, retail brands or financial institutions - all these players want to be able to serve up information that is most relevant to a given time, location and customer.Angel L. Mendez, executive vice president and chief operating officer, HERE Technologies, said: ""Location technology and digital payments are at the heart of how we access services in the physical world. Together they enable people, businesses and cities to deliver, and act on, valued information at the right time and location. We look forward to working with Mastercard on a wide-ranging innovation program that will help shape the personal experience of users across transportation modes and within smarter cities.""Under the agreement, HERE will also join City Possible, an initiative to foster new forms of collaboration between the private and the public sector for more inclusive and more sustainable urban development.HERE Technologies is backed by Audi, BMW, Daimler, Intel and Pioneer, with Bosch and Continental also poised to become shareholders in 2018.About MastercardMastercard (NYSE: MA), www.mastercard.com, is a technology company in the global payments industry.

While this helps them diversify to some degree, it‰Ûªs also a drag on margins and makes them more susceptible to losses when the economy stumbles. While they are not bad companies, they don‰Ûªt have the type of bread-and-butter credit card fee businesses that V and MA thrive on.Not only do I find the business models and management teams of V and MA superior to AXP and others, but I find them more attractive in a myriad of other ways too. All three companies benefit from the growth of credit and debit over cash and check. But, more specifically, the growth overseas for V and MA is more impressive.Another consideration? Partnerships. For years, Amex was the credit card brand for Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ: COST ), one of the only retailers that‰Ûªs holding its own against Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ). Well last year, Amex lost its partnership with that company after failing to negotiate a deal that worked for both parties. Who won it? Visa.Speaking of Amazon, Visa has also partnered on its Prime Rewards card.Valuing AXP Stock PriceAXP stock isn‰Ûªt all that bad. Just last month, shares were sporting 12-month gains of 30%. While that figure has slipped to just 17% gains, the returns are still pretty good. Further, its dividend yields about 1.5%. Expectations for 21% earnings growth and 9.5% sales growth in 2018 is also solid, even if those growth rates slow to 11% and 6.3% in 2019, respectively.Also on the plus side is AXP stock‰Ûªs low valuation! American Express stock trades at just 12.7 times 2018 earnings estimates. That‰Ûªs pretty darn cheap for a double-digit earnings-grower, even if the new tax laws are giving it a big kicker this year. For me, though, I would personally rather pay a premium for a higher quality company. Visa and Mastercard fit the bill here. These stocks trade at a lofty 26 and 28 times 2018 earnings estimates, respectively.However, analysts expect MA to grow earnings 31% in 2018 and another 17.5% in 2019. They‰Ûªre calling for sales to grow a robust 16% in 2018 and 12.5% in 2019.For V, analysts expect 26.7% earnings growth this year and 18% in 2019. On the revenue front, forecasts call for 10% growth this year and 11% in 2019.These companies have sported double-digit earnings and revenue growth for years and, because of their overseas growth, that will likely continue. Further, just look at their margins. V sports profit margins of almost 40%, while MA rings in at more than 31%. AXP? Less than 9%. There‰Ûªs a reason V and MA trade at a premium and AXP trades at a discount. In this case, I‰Ûªm more than happy to pay the premium.Trading American Express StockI know I‰Ûªm painting a bad picture on AXP stock here, but that‰Ûªs not the intent. It‰Ûªs a fine company and a decent stock. I just don‰Ûªt find it attractive like I do for other names in the space. That goes for the chart of AXP stock too.Click to EnlargeAs you can see, the AXP stock price recently closed below its 200-day moving average. Resistance near $102 is pretty clear and, so far, $88 has been support. But a decline into the mid-$80s wouldn‰Ûªt be surprising, as AXP stock price spent much of last summer consolidating in this area. Also, the 50-day is crossing below the 100-day moving average, showing that momentum is not working in AXP‰Ûªs favor.Now look at V and MA:Both stock have all three major moving averages steadily trending higher. Both are pulling back into support. While they are under pressure, these charts are much more constructive than that of AXP. For this reason (and fundamentally), I‰Ûªd rather go with V and MA over AXP stock.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell.

"Mastercard CEO Attacks Bitcoin, Finds Solace in Government-Backed Cryptos","Ajay Banga, CEO of Mastercard, has leveled a scathing attack on any and all cryptocurrencies that are not government mandated, calling them ‰ÛÏjunk‰Ûù.Digital currencies are almost direct competition for a company like Mastercard, and when asked his opinion on the futuristic technology, Banga was not complimentary of how things stand at the moment.Big disruptorKnowing that digital currencies are big disrupters in the traditional money market, traditional investors, and now even established money movers, have been scathing.Banga was not totally against the idea of Blockchain-based money and tokenization, however, his big caveat was that it needs to be government backed.‰ÛÏIf the government creates digital currency, we will find a way to be in the game. We will provide rails for moving currency from customer to merchant. The government mandated digital currencies are interesting. Non-government mandated currency is junk,‰Ûù he said.Normal rhetoricBanga‰Ûªs attack on Bitcoin brought up nothing new or visionary, spurting the usual concerns without much backing or research. He criticised Bitcoin for its volatility, and use-cases for illegal activities, such as ransomware attacks:‰ÛÏIf I pay for a bottle of water in Bitcoin, one day it is two bottles for a Bitcoin the other day it is 9,000 bottles. This does not work. Any currency needs stability and transparency, otherwise you will get all the illegal activities in the world. Why was the ransom for the virus (wannacry ransomware) collected in Bitcoin? Why has China cracked down on Bitcoin?‰ÛùBanga seems to be another bigwig who has a stake in the game, and thus is not happy to give up that piece of pie. He, along with traditional bankers and investors, are fearful of Bitcoin as it continues to break new ground and blow precedents out of the water.The Wall Street divideThe divide of big names on Wall Street seems to grow daily as those in the camp of Jamie Dimon, who called Bitcoin a ‰Û÷fraud‰Ûª continue to recruit those who seem to be more fearful than certain.Meanwhile, there are those who are looking to profit, and those who are major backers, despite coming from traditional and closed-off investment channels.Axel Weber, the former President of Bundesbank and Chairman UBS, said:‰ÛÏI get often asked why I‰Û÷m so skeptical about Bitcoin, it probably comes from my background as a central banker.‰ÛùMeanwhile, Brock Pierce, Chairman of the Bitcoin Foundation, is taking these knee-jerk reactions as good things.‰ÛÏWhen the incumbent industry is making statements like this and acknowledging you...it‰Ûªs a sign that what we‰Ûªre doing is working...it‰Ûªs a huge validation,‰Ûù said Pierce.","Digital currencies are almost direct competition for a company like Mastercard, and when asked his opinion on the futuristic technology, Banga was not complimentary of how things stand at the moment.Big disruptorKnowing that digital currencies are big disrupters in the traditional money market, traditional investors, and now even established money movers, have been scathing.‰ÛÏIf the government creates digital currency, we will find a way to be in the game.The government mandated digital currencies are interesting.Non-government mandated currency is junk,‰Ûù he said.","['cryptos', 'currencies', 'street', 'ceo', 'digital', 'governmentbacked', 'wall', 'bitcoin', 'attacks', 'solace', 'currency', 'finds', 'mandated', 'traditional', 'money', 'mastercard', 'big']",,,[],2017-10-09 17:40:00+01:00,https://cointelegraph.com/news/mastercard-ceo-attacks-bitcoin-finds-solace-in-government-backed-cryptos,,,,
Mastercard's Move To Upgrade Fleet Cards,"When most payments people are talking or thinking about the intersection of things and payments, Mastercard‰Û÷s VP of commerce for every device, Matt Miller, noted that their mindset is typically about turning devices that consumers use today ‰ÛÒ watches, fitness trackers and even appliances ‰ÛÒ into devices capable of initiating a payment.It‰Ûªs only half of the connected-device-turned-payment device story, Miller said in a recent conversation with PYMNTS and Mastercard‰Ûªs senior vice president, commerce for every device, Kiki Del Valle. Just as exciting, he said, is finding ways to make products work better by payment-enabling them.And that instinct to make things work better, Del Valle said, is the inspiration behind Mastercard‰Ûªs new IoT-enhanced fleet management toolset.Today‰Ûªs fleet drivers, Del Valle noted, face a cumbersome, inefficient and error-prone process. Drivers pull into the pump, pay with their corporate-issued fleet cards and then manually record their odometer reading and driver ID.‰ÛÏIt‰Ûªs a recipe for drivers to make errors, and for fleet managers to overspend on fuel,‰Ûù Del Valle noted, adding that can sometimes even mean the employee ‰ÛÏfills up their own fleet vehicle, and then all of their personal lawn care equipment and their best friend‰Ûªs car to boot.‰ÛùFleet managers know this to be an issue, she said, but it‰Ûªs one that‰Ûªs not always easy to spot, or at least to spot quickly. Del Valle said that Mastercard‰Ûªs fleet management solution integrates the fuel and maintenance data into the payment process once the card is activated by using IoT and tying it directly to the fleet card.The goal, she said, is to simplify the process for the driver while increasing data and payments transparency for the fleet manager ‰ÛÒ and to also help the humble fleet card evolve toward bigger and better things within the organizations that use them.How It WorksCards issued via Mastercard‰Ûªs fleet management platform can be issued on a per-driver or per-vehicle basis. Once activated, the card and vehicle data are synced so that each card can be linked to the fleet‰Ûªs vehicles. When the driver arrives at the pump, the vehicle reports its location, odometer and fuel gauge level.That data, Del Valle said, will either be recorded and broadcast via the built-in, connected telematics elements within the vehicle, or via a dongle retrofitted for the vehicle‰Ûªs needs. At that point, the purchase amount is matched to the amount of fuel that was required, if the system detects that overspending has occurred, an alert is sent to both the driver and the fleet manager about the overage.The driver gets a simpler experience, and is freed from manually recording data on the road. Fleet managers get transparency into their fleet‰Ûªs spend and have the ability to address potential problems in real time, enabling them to resolve issues where there is apparent overspend, but for a perfectly good reason.‰ÛÏSome firms do have equipment other than the vehicle itself that requires fuel,‰Ûù Del Valle said, adding that in such a case, something that appears to be an ‰ÛÏoverage‰Ûù can be cleared as a totally legitimate use of the card.Room for CustomizationGiving fleet managers real-time visibility opens new opportunities for them to tailor the program for spend outside of fuel and to replace the more traditional T&E card. That can include a number of new use cases, Del Valle noted, ranging from the care and maintenance of their vehicles to the extension of per diems with set limits on food and lodging expenses ‰ÛÒ all with built-in controls that keep spending in check.U.S. Bank will be the first to pilot these new features with its fleet card customers, with a goal of having these features on the road by 2019.‰ÛÏThere is a lot of excitement for finding a [fleet] solution that can bring additional benefits to the industry as a whole,‰Ûù Del Valle noted.She is convinced that the internet of things ‰ÛÒ and connected cars ‰ÛÒ will be the force that will set this type of fleet card solution into motion, but not only because it makes it easier for drivers to make a fuel purchase.‰ÛÏThis solution isn‰Ûªt just about enabling a payment in a new way, but by making the fleet card experience more valuable than they‰Ûªve been in the past, by connecting those payments to the right data in real time.‰Ûù","And that instinct to make things work better, Del Valle said, is the inspiration behind Mastercard‰Ûªs new IoT-enhanced fleet management toolset.Today‰Ûªs fleet drivers, Del Valle noted, face a cumbersome, inefficient and error-prone process.Del Valle said that Mastercard‰Ûªs fleet management solution integrates the fuel and maintenance data into the payment process once the card is activated by using IoT and tying it directly to the fleet card.How It WorksCards issued via Mastercard‰Ûªs fleet management platform can be issued on a per-driver or per-vehicle basis.U.S. Bank will be the first to pilot these new features with its fleet card customers, with a goal of having these features on the road by 2019.","['things', 'valle', 'del', 'vehicle', 'upgrade', 'driver', 'cards', 'mastercards', 'fleet', 'data', 'card', 'fuel']",,,[],2018-05-23 04:03:40+00:00,https://www.pymnts.com/mastercard/2018/fleet-cards-management-iot-drivers/,,,,

Credit card signatures are ending in the US on April 13th,"Credit card signatures are about to become a thing of the past, with American Express, Mastercard, Visa, and Discover ‰ÛÓ the four major US credit card companies ‰ÛÓ set to do away with the requirement for signatures on in-store purchases in the coming days. American Express, Mastercard, and Discover have all confirmed that they‰Ûªll be flipping the switch on April 13th, while Visa should be following later in the month.We‰Ûªve known it was coming for a while, with all four companies announcing that they‰Ûªd be eliminating the signature sometime in April. But tomorrow will mark the beginning of the end for the signature, which admittedly has been on the way out for years. Most credit card companies stopped requiring them for smaller transactions as early as 2010, and things like checks and handwritten letters have been on the decline for decades with the advent of the smartphone and computer.The signature isn‰Ûªt being dealt a single death blow all at oncePlus, as The New York Times points out, the signature isn‰Ûªt being dealt a single death blow all at once. All that the major credit card companies are doing is getting rid of the requirement for companies to have a signature: it‰Ûªll be up to stores to decide whether or not they‰Ûªd like to eliminate them. Some, like Target and Walmart, plan to get rid of them later this month, while others ‰ÛÓ like Square, which has card readers used by a huge number of small merchants ‰ÛÓ will still require you to scrawl your John Hancock to authenticate your purchase.Different credit card companies are also getting rid of the restriction in slightly different ways. American Express, for example, is nixing the requirement around the world, while Visa is making it optional only in North America for companies that offer chip systems. Mastercard is limiting it to just the US and Canada, while Discover won‰Ûªt need signatures in US, Canada, Mexico, and the Caribbean. Even though it‰Ûªs an international change, signatures are largely only a part of the checkout system in the US, since most other countries have switched to chip-and-PIN authentication.Mastercard first announced that it would be removing the signature requirement back in October of last year, with the argument that signatures were slowing down checkout and were less secure than other new digital security techniques for preventing fraud, and was quickly followed by the other three major companies.But it‰Ûªs important to note that while US credit card companies are finally getting rid of the signature, none of them are taking the extra step of replacing it with the far more secure chip-and-PIN authentication that Europe uses. A few years ago, the US finally came on board with the more secure EMV chips in its cards (largely due to a policy that would penalize issuers and stores that didn‰Ûªt shift over to chipped cards). But US payment processors refused to add the other half of the European system ‰ÛÓ requiring a four-digit PIN to verify a purchase, and instead relying on a signature to authenticate.And while the desire to speed up checkouts by removing the largely useless signature is in theory a good thing ‰ÛÓ especially since signatures probably weren‰Ûªt doing much to prevent fraud in the first place ‰ÛÓ it‰Ûªs a shame that companies aren‰Ûªt taking this chance to finally bring the US up to speed with the rest of the world and replace signatures with PINs.","Credit card signatures are about to become a thing of the past, with American Express, Mastercard, Visa, and Discover ‰ÛÓ the four major US credit card companies ‰ÛÓ set to do away with the requirement for signatures on in-store purchases in the coming days.Most credit card companies stopped requiring them for smaller transactions as early as 2010, and things like checks and handwritten letters have been on the decline for decades with the advent of the smartphone and computer.All that the major credit card companies are doing is getting rid of the requirement for companies to have a signature: it‰Ûªll be up to stores to decide whether or not they‰Ûªd like to eliminate them.Different credit card companies are also getting rid of the restriction in slightly different ways.Mastercard is limiting it to just the US and Canada, while Discover won‰Ûªt need signatures in US, Canada, Mexico, and the Caribbean.","['requirement', 'visa', 'secure', 'signature', 'ending', 'companies', 'mastercard', 'signatures', 'credit', 'card', 'rid', '13th']",,,['Apr'],4/12/18 0:00,https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/12/17225554/credit-card-signatures-us-ending-companies-pin-emv-chip,,,,

PayPal Commits To Financial Inclusion,"There was a lot going on during PayPal‰Ûªs quarterly earnings report yesterday (April 25), as the original ‰ÛÏPay‰Ûù player managed to beat analyst expectations nearly across the board and even forecast a better-than-expected result for the rest of the year.Growth was the big story: PayPal saw transactions on its platform increase, its user base swell by an additional 8 million active users and its P2P platform Venmo rapidly grow its footprint. Even the number of partnerships the company is pursuing with other big players in the ecosystem is climbing.Recent days have seen Samsung and Barclays added to an lineup that already includes players like Visa, Mastercard, Wells Fargo, Citibank and Chase ‰ÛÓ just to name a few.While the growth story was key to PayPal‰Ûªs post-earnings victory lap, the firm was also quick to point out it has more to do when it comes to growing its platform. PayPal CEO Dan Schulman told investors that the company is committed to making sure that growth hits everyone ‰ÛÓ particularly those who are currently shut out of traditional financial services markets.‰ÛÏWe firmly believe as a company that everyone should have access to affordable, convenient, secure and low-cost financial services,‰Ûù Schulman said, noting this vision does not ‰ÛÓ as some have speculated in the past ‰ÛÓ speak to an overwhelming desire on PayPal‰Ûªs part to become a bank or to try to replace bank-based services.PayPal does not want to be a bank.‰ÛÏI think what we are trying to do is not try to compete or replace what‰Ûªs going on with banks, but work with the financial system to fill in the gaps in the current system, so that everyone can afford the opportunities that the digital economy is extending,‰Ûù he explained.That means, according to Schulman, being a better cooperator in the U.S. and around the world and finding the right partners to better midwife an era of democratized access to financial services solutions that need to vary and speak to the needs of the underserved population being helped. Not all cases are the same, and thus there is not a one-size-fits-all solution to bring the approximately 2 billion unbanked to the table.Speaking of the estimated 9 million households in the United States that exist outside the financial mainstream, Schulman noted the importance of jailbreaking consumers from under the grip of high-cost, high-friction financial products in favor of a better option.‰ÛÏWe‰Ûªre working closely with partners across the financial ecosystem to introduce what will be a comprehensive value proposition for the tens of millions of U.S. consumers that currently rely on shadow banking services like check cashers and payday lenders,‰Ûù he said.Those better options have consisted of the ability to load cash into PayPal accounts via a prepaid card, and the acquisition of TIO network last summer to make it easier for unbanked customers to directly and digitally pay their bills.More recently, the company has debuted PayPal Cash Mastercard, which Schulman told investors is ‰ÛÏaimed at giving greater financial flexibility to underserved and unbanked consumers in the United States.‰Ûù The card allows cardholders to spend their PayPal funds at millions of physical store locations, access cash from ATMs and load their PayPal account with cash at over 20,000 retail locations.Consumers can also add direct deposit services to their account or leverage mobile check cashing.‰ÛÏIt is the central tenet of our mission to provide underserved consumers better access to the opportunities afforded by the digital economy, and I‰Ûªm very pleased that we‰Ûªre taking the first steps on this journey,‰Ûù Schulman said.And that journey, he noted, is happening outside the U.S. too.Schulman praised PayPal‰Ûªs recent expansion in India, having successfully completed its pilot program. The company is now able to work with ‰ÛÏmerchants across India‰Ûù to offer the platform to local consumers and PayPal‰Ûªs entire global audience.Schulman also focused on PayPal‰Ûªs recent partnership with African mobile payments powerhouse M-PESA to also push the power of digital payments to the continent‰Ûªs underserved population.‰ÛÏWe recently announced the partnership with M-PESA, the transformative mobile payment system in Kenya. Through our relationship, Kenyans can now seamlessly move money between their M-PESA and PayPal accounts, removing barriers that had prevented Kenyan consumers and businesses from fully participating in the global digital economy,‰Ûù Schulman told investors. ‰ÛÏWith almost 28 million M-PESA customers in Kenya, we see this as a meaningful step forward in working with partners to drive the democratization of financial services.‰ÛùAs for the costs of this commitment to financial inclusion and what it means for PayPal‰Ûªs efforts at not just providing payments, but monetizing them as well? That was the question of Deutsche Bank‰Ûªs Bryan Keane.PayPal‰Ûªs COO Bill Ready noted that this push on PayPal‰Ûªs part is not new and comes as part of the company‰Ûªs long-term, comprehensive effort.‰ÛÏWe‰Ûªve had some products in market for a while that give us exposure to how these products are, one, used by customers and, two, what those mean to us financially ‰ÛÓ both prepaid cards we‰Ûªve had in market for a while, merchant debit cards, things like that,‰Ûù Ready explained.He noted that the company‰Ûªs long exposure in the area has taught them there is not much difference when it comes to offering services to the excluded, or monetizing those services.What PayPal can do ‰ÛÓ has been doing and plans to continue to do ‰ÛÓ Schulman said, is use emerging digital technology to find ways to bring people into the digital era of financial services and commerce in a way that is profitable for all the parties involved.‰ÛÏWe think that we can use technology [to] reimagine financial services for sort of a mobile-first customer and provide not only a great consumer value proposition but also a great proposition from merchants and the rest of the ecosystem as we bring people into the digital economy,‰Ûù Schulman said.","Even the number of partnerships the company is pursuing with other big players in the ecosystem is climbing.PayPal CEO Dan Schulman told investors that the company is committed to making sure that growth hits everyone ‰ÛÓ particularly those who are currently shut out of traditional financial services markets.Speaking of the estimated 9 million households in the United States that exist outside the financial mainstream, Schulman noted the importance of jailbreaking consumers from under the grip of high-cost, high-friction financial products in favor of a better option.Schulman praised PayPal‰Ûªs recent expansion in India, having successfully completed its pilot program.The company is now able to work with ‰ÛÏmerchants across India‰Ûù to offer the platform to local consumers and PayPal‰Ûªs entire global audience.","['underserved', 'digital', 'commits', 'services', 'paypal', 'financial', 'inclusion', 'company', 'better', 'consumers', 'paypals', 'schulman']",,,[],2018-04-26 16:34:32+00:00,https://www.pymnts.com/earnings/2018/paypals-earnings-stocks-venmo/,,,,
"HYPR Joins Latest Mastercard Start Path Program, Receives Series A Investment","Selection Highlights Demand for Decentralized Authentication as Mobile Payments Sector GrowsNEW YORK ‰ÛÒ December 6th, 2017 ‰ÛÒ HYPR Corp., the leading provider of enterprise-facing decentralized authentication solutions, announced today that it has received strategic investment from Mastercard and has been named to the latest class of Mastercard Start Path ‰ÛÒ a global initiative to support innovative companies with the potential to reshape the future of commerce to achieve scale. Coming on the heels of HYPR‰Ûªs recently announced Series A funding round of $8 million led by RRE Ventures, Mastercard‰Ûªs strategic investment further enables HYPR‰Ûªs decentralized authentication solutions to extend into the millions of users across the Mastercard payments ecosystem.With 30 billion devices connected to the Internet of Things (IoT) by 2020, ensuring they are secure and properly authorized when used to make a purchase is critical. HYPR‰Ûªs decentralized authentication solution improves security and reduces the risk of an enterprise data breach by putting consumers‰Ûª credentials on the device itself instead of in a central database.This approach provides consumers with greater security and usability during payments in the digital age. It also has applications for online banking, merchant services, connected cars and other IoT initiatives.‰ÛÏThe importance of secure authentication has never been greater,‰Ûù said Roman Kadinsky, COO of HYPR. ‰ÛÏWorking with Mastercard allows us to bring our decentralized authentication systems to more devices and payments across the IoT.‰Ûù‰ÛÏPeople need the peace of mind that their personal information, their money and their identity are secure in the digital age,‰Ûù said Bob Reany, Executive Vice President of Global Products and Services for Identity Solution at Mastercard. ‰ÛÏWe are committed to advancing a consumer-centric vision of security grounded in giving people the ability to maintain control of their data. HYPR‰Ûªs technology is a smart way to keep critical data where it belongs ‰ÛÒ close to the consumer.‰ÛùIn addition, HYPR will be working to identify and source potential new customers for Mastercard to help deploy a mobile or online biometric authentication solution.About HYPRHYPR Secures Decentralized Access to Our Connected World.Designed for the enterprise, HYPR decentralized authentication ensures that personal credentials such as biometrics, PINs, and passwords always remain safe on users‰Ûª devices. By eliminating the need for a centralized credential store, the risk of an enterprise breach is greatly reduced. With millions of consumers and employees secured across the Fortune 500, HYPR is leading the way in decentralized authentication. Founded in 2014 and now backed by over $14M in Venture Capital from RRE, Mastercard, RTP, Boldstart and Mesh Ventures, HYPR was recently named a ‰ÛÏCool Vendor‰Ûù in Gartner‰Ûªs May 2017 report, ‰ÛÏCool Vendors in Transforming Multichannel to Unified Retail Commerce, 2017‰Ûù.Additional information is available at: https://www.hypr.com/","Coming on the heels of HYPR‰Ûªs recently announced Series A funding round of $8 million led by RRE Ventures, Mastercard‰Ûªs strategic investment further enables HYPR‰Ûªs decentralized authentication solutions to extend into the millions of users across the Mastercard payments ecosystem.HYPR‰Ûªs decentralized authentication solution improves security and reduces the risk of an enterprise data breach by putting consumers‰Ûª credentials on the device itself instead of in a central database.‰ÛÏThe importance of secure authentication has never been greater,‰Ûù said Roman Kadinsky, COO of HYPR.Designed for the enterprise, HYPR decentralized authentication ensures that personal credentials such as biometrics, PINs, and passwords always remain safe on users‰Ûª devices.With millions of consumers and employees secured across the Fortune 500, HYPR is leading the way in decentralized authentication.","['hypr', 'secure', 'enterprise', 'mastercard', 'latest', 'authentication', 'hyprs', 'payments', 'devices', 'receives', 'start', 'investment', 'program', 'joins', 'decentralized', 'path', 'series', 'security']",,,[],2017-12-06 13:18:24-04:00,http://paymentsjournal.com/hypr-joins-latest-mastercard-start-path-program-receives-series-investment/,,,,
Mastercard Plans for EU Biometric Authentication,"Mastercard has announced that by next spring, consumers will be able to identify themselves with biometrics when they shop and pay using their Mastercards.Mastercard Identity Check, currently available in 37 countries, enables individuals to use biometric identifiers, such as fingerprint, iris and facial recognition, to verify their identities when using a mobile device for online shopping and banking.Research shows that a whopping 93 percent of consumers prefer using biometrics over passwords for authenticating payments, while 92 percent of banking professionals say they want to utilize it. The preference for validating through biometrics ‰ÛÒ along with the EU‰Ûªs new regulation for strong authentication ‰ÛÒ makes this a prime time for banks and payment companies to implement the technology.While existing authentication methods can take shoppers away from a retailer‰Ûªs website, an easier solution is to replace the reliance on what the consumer knows (such as passwords) and what they have (card or smart device), and focus on what they have (e.g. mobile phones) and who they are (their biometrics).Aside from the safety and security perks, banks also report that when biometric authentication is used, consumers are more likely to finalize transactions. In fact, abandonment rates drop by up to 70 percent. The solution also speeds up the digital checkout time.‰ÛÏBiometric technologies perfectly meet the public‰Ûªs expectation for state-of-the-art security when making a payment,‰Ûù said Mark Barnett, president of Mastercard UK & Ireland. ‰ÛÏThis will be of great benefit to everyone: consumers, retailers and banks. It will make the purchase much smoother, and instead of having to remember passwords to authenticate, shoppers will have the chance to use a fingerprint or a picture of themselves.‰ÛùMastercard isn‰Ûªt the only payments company utilizing biometrics. Just last week, Visa announced that it is working with U.S. point-of-sale terminal manufacturers ‰ÛÒ such as Equinox Payments, Ingenico Group, Poynt and Verifone ‰ÛÒ to pilot sensory branding with merchant partners in the coming year.","Mastercard has announced that by next spring, consumers will be able to identify themselves with biometrics when they shop and pay using their Mastercards.Mastercard Identity Check, currently available in 37 countries, enables individuals to use biometric identifiers, such as fingerprint, iris and facial recognition, to verify their identities when using a mobile device for online shopping and banking.Research shows that a whopping 93 percent of consumers prefer using biometrics over passwords for authenticating payments, while 92 percent of banking professionals say they want to utilize it.Aside from the safety and security perks, banks also report that when biometric authentication is used, consumers are more likely to finalize transactions.‰ÛÏBiometric technologies perfectly meet the public‰Ûªs expectation for state-of-the-art security when making a payment,‰Ûù said Mark Barnett, president of Mastercard UK & Ireland.","['using', 'banks', 'biometric', 'shoppers', 'solution', 'authentication', 'eu', 'plans', 'payments', 'biometrics', 'consumers', 'mastercard', 'passwords', 'security']",,,[],2018-01-24 07:10:32+00:00,https://www.pymnts.com/mastercard/2018/mastercard-european-biometrics-authentication-id-verification/,,,,

Mastercard adds connected car services,"Mastercard has signalled its intention to move into the connected car services market with a new offering designed to automate the process of using a fleet card to pay for fuel at the pump.Currently, company car drivers must manually enter in their driver ID and odometer reading every time they use a fleet card to pay at the pump, which can lead to mistakes.Mastercard‰Ûªs new service automatically integrates fuel and maintenance data from a connected car into the payment process. The service will streamline the process, providing fleet managers greater transparency and control.Kiki Del Valle, senior vice-president, of Mastercard‰Ûªs commerce for every device division, said: ‰ÛÏTechnology is unlocking new ways to deliver greater peace of mind.‰ÛÏCombining digital payment capabilities with data from connected vehicles allows banks to give fleet managers a unique view into the inner workings of their business.‰ÛùWith the new Mastercard service, fleet vehicles that drive into a petrol station will automatically register vehicle data including location, odometer and fuel gauge readings when they arrive at the pump, so drivers won‰Ûªt have to manually enter their data.If a driver spends more on fuel than what is required by the car, both the fleet manager and the driver can receive an alert. Fleet managers will also have the ability to add customizable controls that allow a driver to use the card for purchases other than fuel if desired.US Bank will be the first to pilot these new features.Dominic Venturo, chief innovation officer, US Bank, said: ‰ÛÏUS Bank fleet customers have been seeking ways to enhance spend control, improve security and gain more visibility - all at the very speed their businesses operate.‰ÛÏBringing this vision to life with Mastercard is an important next step in making their companies more efficient.‰ÛùThe US Bank pilot will also feature Mastercard dynamic spend controls to enable real-time permissions for per-diem and lodging approvals and unexpected repairs at a designated service station.","Mastercard has signalled its intention to move into the connected car services market with a new offering designed to automate the process of using a fleet card to pay for fuel at the pump.Mastercard‰Ûªs new service automatically integrates fuel and maintenance data from a connected car into the payment process.The service will streamline the process, providing fleet managers greater transparency and control.If a driver spends more on fuel than what is required by the car, both the fleet manager and the driver can receive an alert.Dominic Venturo, chief innovation officer, US Bank, said: ‰ÛÏUS Bank fleet customers have been seeking ways to enhance spend control, improve security and gain more visibility - all at the very speed their businesses operate.","['connected', 'process', 'services', 'managers', 'driver', 'bank', 'fleet', 'data', 'car', 'mastercard', 'adds', 'fuel', 'service']",,,[],2018-05-24 11:17:43+00:00,https://www.assetfinanceinternational.com/index.php/fleet-finance/fleet-americas/fleet-americas-week/17001-mastercard-adds-connected-car-services,,,,

(Photo: LSJ file photo)EAST LANSING - A foundation focused on giving students from sub-Saharan Africa the opportunity to further their education has severed its relationship with Michigan State University.The Mastercard Foundation has cut short what was meant to be a nine-year program with MSU that began in 2012. Under the terms of MSU's participation in the Mastercard Foundation Scholars Program, it was to receive $45 million over that time period to support 185 undergraduate and graduate students.""The Mastercard Foundation is dedicated to providing a safe environment for young people who participate in our programs,"" an emailed statement from the foundation began. ""Due to extensive media reporting about issues involving Michigan State University (MSU), the Foundation has lost confidence in our partnership with the university.""There are 109 Mastercard scholars on campus currently and another 50 who've already completed their programs and graduated, MSU officials confirmed Tuesday.Recipients of the scholarship receive assistance with tuition costs as well as for support services and leadership development. Those currently attending MSU will continue to receive the foundation's support through the completion of their programs, according to its statement.The foundation will also pay for any costs to-date from the MSU Agriculture Youth Opportunity Lab, a collaboration between MSU and the foundation that began last year.The five-year, $13-million arrangement aimed to help 15,000 people locate opportunities in horticulture and related fields in Tanzania and Nigeria, according to an MSU press release.""MSU did receive notification from the Mastercard Foundation and notified all impacted students and partners,"" MSU spokesperson Emily Guerrant wrote in an email. ""We appreciate that the Foundation acknowledged this decision was difficult and that they expressed their ongoing respect for all people engaged in the programs. Our focus now is the continued support of the current students through their graduation.""Related:$45 million grant helps Africans attend MSUMSU students form human teal ribbon to cap off It's On Us Week on campusFormer MSU students say William Strampel had a history of lewd behaviorIn 2012, the Mastercard Foundation announced plans to spend $500 million on an initiative to support students from African countries furthering their education.

We will continue to cover the costs of their education, support services, and leadership development that are part of a comprehensive package offered by the Scholars Program. This support will continue until these Scholars graduate. We will work to support their safety and well-being. The Foundation will also honour any expenses incurred to date under the MSU Agriculture Youth Opportunity Lab projects as part of the termination of this partnership.""""Students interested in enrolling in the Mastercard Foundation Scholars Program for the 2018-2019 school year are encouraged to visit our website for a full list of partner universities involved in the Program.

Mastercard Stock in 5 Charts,"Mastercard's (NYSE:MA) business is booming.The following charts tell the story.The relentless growth of e-commerceFew businesses are benefiting as much as Mastercard from the torrid growth of online sales. As one of the largest credit card networks, Mastercard is particularly well positioned to profit from the massive global shift toward digital payments and away from cash transactions.Steadily rising revenueMastercard earns a small fee from every transaction that passes through its payment network, and its tollbooth-like business model produces a steadily rising stream of high-margin revenue.Surging profitsMastercard is an incredibly profitable business. Over the trailing 12 months, the payments titan produced operating and net margins of 54% and 39%, respectively.Strong cash generationMastercard's asset-light business model requires minimal capital expenditures; it can add new merchants and cardholders to its network at little incremental cost. As such, Mastercard excels at turning its revenue into bountiful free cash flow.Capital returnsMastercard is committed to passing a sizable portion of its cash flow on to its investors through share repurchases and a growing dividend.Although Mastercard currently yields only 0.6%, that's mostly a reflection of its surging share price.

"Kempner: Goodbye, signatures? Credit card firms make big change","UPDATEDDon‰Ûªt take this too hard: your autograph isn‰Ûªt worth what it once was.American Express, Mastercard and Discover have each announced that, starting in April, they will no longer require signatures on any North American credit card purchases. (Actually, American Express is making the change for all its transactions worldwide.)UPDATE: And now Visa has announced it, too, will cut requirements for signing, though only for merchants set up to handle cards with EMV chips.The moves nearly evaporate what may be the most common reason U.S. consumers still bother writing signatures, which were once the most prominent symbol of our financial integrity and proof of our identity. (It‰Ûªs also another blow to the general use of cursive writing, for those who remember what that is.)Like lava lamps‰ÛÏSignatures may be going the way of the lava lamp,‰Ûù said William McCracken, the president of Phoenix Synergistics, a metro Atlanta-based consumer market research company focused on the financial services.‰ÛÏThey will not be part of Gen Z. Signatures won‰Ûªt be part of their stored memories.‰ÛùThe shift away from signatures also hints at the fantasy we all pretended to believe: that signatures actually proved something.‰ÛÏThe industry‰Ûªs unspoken secret is that signatures on a credit card receipt are relatively worthless from a security standpoint,‰Ûù McCracken said.Thieves only had to look at the signature on the back of a credit card, practice it a few times and come up with a fake good enough to pass.Who even checks?But even that involves some quaint thinking. Because almost no one in places where we shop or dine is even glancing at signatures these days, whether you signed on paper or a glitchy electronic pad using a faulty stylus or your finger.That would seem to explain why I‰Ûªve never been flagged for using my finger to draw a line across checkout signature pads.Signatures are still used on plenty of legal property documents, government-issued IDs, artwork, acknowledgments of medical privacy notifications, cards to grandma and anything fans can ask celebrities to scribble on.Signature challengesYet, in other ways signatures have been slipping from the economy.Instead of putting his ‰ÛÏsignature‰Ûù on new dollar bills earlier this year, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin used a handwritten mix of upper- and lower-cased block letters that could have been thumbed out on a smartphone.+ Jacquelyn Martin / ASSOCIATED PRESS Jacquelyn Martin / ASSOCIATED PRESS ÌÑ Personal signatures are slowly losing relevance. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, right, (shown with his wife Louise Linton) used block letters ... read moreSignatures became less necessary as check writing shrank. And while credit card use continues to grow ‰ÛÓ there were more than 37 billion U.S. transactions last year totaling $3.27 trillion dollars ‰ÛÓ most of that is going unsigned.John Hancocks aren‰Ûªt required on typical online purchases.Finger signaturesAnd credit card firms already scaled back signature requirements on small transactions. More than 75 percent of face-to-face Visa card transactions in North America don‰Ûªt require people to sign their name, according to a Visa spokesperson.Which is just as well.Who hasn‰Ûªt gone to sign for a credit card purchase using a pen that doesn‰Ûªt work and ‰ÛÏyou just scribble anyway,‰Ûù said Kim Sullivan, the senior director of payments solutions for Georgia-based transactions technology giant NCR.Dropping signature requirements should speed up lines at retailers, Sullivan said, which is exactly what store owners are looking for.‰ÛÏIt‰Ûªs going to improve the experience‰Ûù for merchants and consumers, she said.‰ÛÏIt‰Ûªs all about faster and frictionless,‰Ûù she said.Security concernsSullivan guesstimated that eliminating signatures might save an average of three seconds on each credit card transaction. So retailers can increase the number of customers they serve and generate more money, she said.+ Doug Mills / The New York Times Doug Mills / The New York Times ÌÑ Some requirements for signatures haven‰Ûªt yet disappeared.

And some consumers are creeped out about the idea of entrusting credit card companies with personal biometric data that could help verify their identity.Other security measures are already in place, such as checking the cards‰Ûª three- or four-digit CVV number, asking consumers for their billing ZIP code, adding computer chips to more cards and monitoring for unusual purchasing activity.But the cruelest reality of saying goodbye to our signatures is this: apparently they already have so little value there isn‰Ûªt a sweeping rush to replace them with something new.","‰ÛÏThe industry‰Ûªs unspoken secret is that signatures on a credit card receipt are relatively worthless from a security standpoint,‰Ûù McCracken said.Finger signaturesAnd credit card firms already scaled back signature requirements on small transactions.Security concernsSullivan guesstimated that eliminating signatures might save an average of three seconds on each credit card transaction.Security is already the biggest concern people have about using credit cards, said McCracken from Synergistics.For now, there has been no widespread rush to require use of PIN codes with credit cards transactions in the United States.","['using', 'change', 'requirements', 'signature', 'writing', 'transactions', 'cards', 'firms', 'goodbye', 'kempner', 'signatures', 'consumers', 'credit', 'card', 'big']",,,"['Matt Kempner', 'Ligaya Figueras', 'Michael E.

Now we can see it in Mastercard Incorporated.We will examine the outcome of getting long a weekly call option in Mastercard Incorporated 7-days before earnings (using) and selling the call before the earnings announcement.Here's the set-up in great clarity; again, note that the trade closes, so this trademake a bet on the earnings result.We can add another layer of risk management to the back-test by instituting and 40% stop loss and a 40% limit gain. Here is that setting:In English, at the close of each trading day we check to see if the long option is either up or down 40% relative to the open price. If it was, the trade was closed.Here are the results over the last three-years in Mastercard Incorporated:The mechanics of the TradeMachine‰ã¢ are that it uses end of day prices for every back-test entry and exit (every trigger).We see a 134.3% return, testing this over the last 12 earnings dates in Mastercard Incorporated. That's a total of just 84 days (7-days for each earnings date, over 12 earnings dates). This has been the results of following the trend of bullish sentiment into earnings while avoiding the actual earnings result.We can also see that this strategy hasn't been a winner all the time, rather it has won 8 times and lost 4 times, for a 67% win-rate and again, that 134.3% return in less than six-full months of trading.While this strategy had an overall return of%, the trade details keep us in bounds with expectations:The average percent returnwas 11.5%.MA: Long 40 Delta Call% Wins: 75.00% Wins: 3 Losses: 1 % Return: 236.9%Tap Here to See the Back-test‰_ÁIt's a fair question to ask if these returns are simply a reflection of a bull market rather than a successful strategy. It turns out that this phenomenon of pre-earnings optimism also worked very well during 2007-2008, when the S&P 500 collapsed into the ""Great Recession.""The average return for this strategy,, using the Nasdaq 100 and Dow 30 as the study group, saw a 45.3% return over those 2-years. And, of course, these are just 8 trades per stock, each lasting 7 days.* Yes. We are empirical.* Yes, you are better than the rest now that you know this.* Yes, you are powerful for it.Now we can look at just the last year as well:We're now looking at 236.9% returns, on 3 winning trades and 1 losing trades.The average percent return over the last yearwas 46.8%.Bullish momentum and sentiment ahead of earnings has been, empirically, a repeating pattern both in a bull and bear market for some companies.

"Mastercard ‰ÛÏVery Happy‰Ûù to Support [State] Cryptocurrencies, Just Not Anonymous ‰ÛÏJunk‰Ûù","AdvertisementPayments giant Mastercard is fully behind supporting state-backed, central bank-issued cryptocurrencies, a senior executive has revealed.In an interview with the Financial Times, Mastercard Asia-Pacific co-president Ari Sarker has opined that the world‰Ûªs second-biggest payments company would be ‰ÛÏvery happy to look at‰Ûù supporting national digital currencies that are issued and backed by central banks.He told the publication:‰ÛÏIf governments look to create national digital currency we‰Ûªd be very happy to look at those in a more favorable way [compared with existing decentralized cryptocurrencies].‰Ûù‰ÛÏSo long as it‰Ûªs backed by a regulator and the value‰Û_‰Ûù he said, adding ‰ÛÏit is not anonymous, it is meeting all the regulatory requirements, I think that would be of greater interest for us to explore.‰ÛùCentral bank-issued cryptocurrencies are currently garnering plenty of interest amid widely-publicized research efforts undertaken by a number of nations including China, Singapore, Canada, Israel, South Africa, Sweden and more. They are, however, yet to materialize despite the likes of China and Singapore successfully trialing digitized versions of their fiat currency on a blockchain. The first notable release of a state cryptocurrency, for better or worse, is the controversial oil-backed Petro, proclaimed as a national cryptocurrency that will evade international sanctions by Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro.The Mastercard executive‰Ûªs revelatory remarks follow those of president and CEO Ajay Banga who dismissed all non-government mandated cryptocurrency as ‰ÛÏjunk‰Ûù last year. ‰ÛÏIf the government creates digital currency, we will find a way to be in the game. We will provide rails for moving currency from customer to merchant,‰Ûù he stated at the time. ‰ÛÏThe government mandated digital currencies are interesting. Non-government mandated currency is junk.‰ÛùFurther, Sarkar touched upon a bitcoin-to-fiat pilot that enabled customers to ‰ÛÏcash out of bitcoin‰Ûù over to a MasterCard. Few details are known, but a pilot is currently underway in Singapore and Japan even though it hasn‰Ûªt reached any particular resemblance of ‰ÛÏscale‰Ûù, according to the executive.‰ÛÏWe are not operating trading of bitcoin through the Mastercard network,‰Ûù Sarkar said of the decidedly cautious approach by Mastercard. ‰ÛÏ[The pilot] is a toe in the water, we‰Ûªre fully cognizant of the reputational risk.‰ÛùAside from filing for blockchain-related patents last year, Mastercard has also unveiled three blockchain APIs that covers features including real-time settlements, smart contracts and a toolkit for users running their own nodes on a blockchain.Mastercard and rival Visa have both classified bitcoin purchases as ‰ÛÏcash transactions‰Ûù, the FT report adds, putting a hurdle for users to purchase cryptocurrencies due to higher fees. Sarkar‰Ûªs take on Mastercard‰Ûªs lack of support for decentralized cryptocurrencies is entirely expected and far more reserved than those offered by Visa‰Ûªs finance chief who mouthed off a privileged tirade against cryptocurrencies recently.Featured image from Shutterstock.","The first notable release of a state cryptocurrency, for better or worse, is the controversial oil-backed Petro, proclaimed as a national cryptocurrency that will evade international sanctions by Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro.The Mastercard executive‰Ûªs revelatory remarks follow those of president and CEO Ajay Banga who dismissed all non-government mandated cryptocurrency as ‰ÛÏjunk‰Ûù last year.‰ÛÏIf the government creates digital currency, we will find a way to be in the game.Non-government mandated currency is junk.‰ÛùFurther, Sarkar touched upon a bitcoin-to-fiat pilot that enabled customers to ‰ÛÏcash out of bitcoin‰Ûù over to a MasterCard.‰ÛÏWe are not operating trading of bitcoin through the Mastercard network,‰Ûù Sarkar said of the decidedly cautious approach by Mastercard.","['cryptocurrency', 'pilot', 'anonymous', 'digital', 'state', 'currency', 'singapore', 'national', 'happy', 'cryptocurrencies', 'mandated', 'mastercard', 'look', 'junk', 'support']",,,[],2018-03-19 17:48:55+00:00,https://www.ccn.com/mastercard-very-happy-to-support-state-cryptocurrencies-just-not-anonymous-junk/,,,,

Mastercard debuts DIY fingerprint kit for biometric cards,"In the ongoing quest to replace PINs and passwords, Mastercard has introduced a kit enabling consumers to register their own fingerprint on a biometric card at home, bypassing the need to visit a bank.When consumers receive an EMV card from their issuer equipped with Mastercard‰Ûªs fingerprint recognition technology, they may enroll their biometric data on the card using their finger and a special sleeve that accompanies the card, Mastercard said in a Tuesday press release.The streamlined enrollment process is Mastercard‰Ûªs latest attempt to improve biometric approaches to authenticating card users. Its other biometric card-authentication solutions include smartphone-based ‰ÛÏselfie pay‰Ûù and iris-scanning.With the new in-home enrollment process, consumers receive an enrollment kit in the mail separately from the card, a Mastercard spokesperson explained. The consumer inserts the card and the battery-powered sleeve activates enrollment, registering the user‰Ûªs fingerprint on the card‰Ûªs sensor.‰ÛÏThe biometric card draws power from the payment terminal so it can be used anywhere. We use a flexible biometric scanner so it‰Ûªs more durable, and now we have a sleeve to register fingerprints so people don‰Ûªt have to make a trip to a bank branch,‰Ûù said Bob Reany, Mastercard‰Ûªs executive vice president of identity solutions, in the release.Eliminating the requirement to enroll consumers‰Ûª biometric data on fingerprint cards at bank branches cuts costs and could speed adoption for participating issuers, Mastercard noted in the release.Mastercard launched the fingerprint scanning technology last year after piloting it in two separate trials in South Africa and a third one in Bulgaria. Other pilots are underway, but no issuers have disclosed rollout plans, the Mastercard spokesperson said.","In the ongoing quest to replace PINs and passwords, Mastercard has introduced a kit enabling consumers to register their own fingerprint on a biometric card at home, bypassing the need to visit a bank.With the new in-home enrollment process, consumers receive an enrollment kit in the mail separately from the card, a Mastercard spokesperson explained.The consumer inserts the card and the battery-powered sleeve activates enrollment, registering the user‰Ûªs fingerprint on the card‰Ûªs sensor.‰ÛÏThe biometric card draws power from the payment terminal so it can be used anywhere.Eliminating the requirement to enroll consumers‰Ûª biometric data on fingerprint cards at bank branches cuts costs and could speed adoption for participating issuers, Mastercard noted in the release.","['card', 'sleeve', 'biometric', 'enrollment', 'users', 'technology', 'cards', 'debuts', 'mastercards', 'consumers', 'fingerprint', 'diy', 'mastercard', 'kit']",,,['Kate Fitzgerald'],2018-05-01 12:00:45.209000-04:00,https://www.paymentssource.com/news/mastercard-debuts-diy-fingerprint-kit-for-biometric-cards,,,,
"Mastercard Stock Upgraded -- and Downgraded, Too","Every day, Wall Street analysts upgrade some stocks, downgrade others, and ""initiate coverage"" on a few more. But do these analysts even know what they're talking about? Today, we're taking one high-profile Wall Street pick and putting it under the microscope...Shares of credit card processor Mastercard (NYSE:MA) are enjoying a nice 2% bump in early trading Thursday. On the one hand, this isn't too surprising. Mastercard appears to be benefiting from a positive note from Tokyo-based Mizuho Securities, which announced this morning that it is upgrading Mastercard stock and assigning the shares a $175 price target.On the other hand, though, Mastercard's rise is a bit surprising, given that at the same time Mizuho was upgrading it, analysts at RBC Capital -- a much better-rated analyst on Motley Fool CAPS -- decided to downgrade Mastercard.So what's up with that? Here are three things you need to know.Why Mizuho upgradedLet's start with the good news. Citing ""[i]mproved economic conditions"" that will ""benefit payment volumes and overall transactional activity,"" StreetInsider.com (subscription required) reports that Mizuho upgraded Mastercard to buy.According to Mizuho, this banker has ""conviction"" that Mastercard will produce ""low double digit net revenue growth"" this year and, with the help of share buybacks, turn that into ""high teens EPS growth.""This broadly accords with what investors have come to expect from Mastercard in years past. Over the last five years, Mastercard has booked an average of 11% annual revenue gains and parlayed those into 16% annual gains in net income, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. In fact, Mizuho's one-year estimates might even seem conservative, given that over the next five years, analysts surveyed by S&P Global predict the stock will accelerate net earnings growth to nearly 19% per year.So why is RBC downgrading?Be that as it may, RBC Capital has nonetheless decided it's time to downgrade Mastercard shares. And yet, that news isn't quite as bad as it may sound.Prior to today, RBC has considered Mastercard stock its ""Top Pick"" in the payments sector. After seeing Mastercard surge 47% in 2017, however -- proving RBC right in the process -- RBC is pulling back a bit. (The analyst's ""downgrade"" today only takes Mastercard's stock rating down to outperform, after all.) What's more, RBC tells us (according to TheFly.com) that it expects the same trends of rising oil prices and favorable exchange rates that benefited Mastercard in 2017 to do so again in 2018. Mastercard's revenue should accelerate, and 2018 will see more consumers than ever before using plastic instead of cash to pay their bills.Result: At the same time as RBC changes its rating, per se, the analyst is increasing its price target on Mastercard stock -- all the way to $180.One stock that's better than MastercardThe upshot of all this is that while RBC isn't convinced Mastercard stock will beat all comers in 2018 as it did in 2017, the analyst still likes Mastercard quite a lot -- and predicts the stock will go up about 15% this year. And yet, the question naturally arises: If Mastercard is no longer RBC's top pick, then something else must be.So who is it?Turns out, we know this answer as well. After removing Mastercard's top pick designation today, RBC Capital named Vantiv (NYSE:WP) its new favorite payments stock. According to RBC, now that Cincinnati-based Vantiv owns London-based Worldpay, the new and improved Vantiv is set to show ""accelerating organic growth,"" supplement that with synergies from its acquired Worldpay subsidiary, and pay down the debt absorbed to finance the acquisition, reducing interest costs and boosting profits.Already on Wall Street, analysts are forecasting compound earnings growth of 34% for Vantiv over the next three years -- a rate of increase nearly twice what they predict for Mastercard. RBC, meanwhile, is betting Vantiv will grow even faster, earning at least $4.40 per share in fiscal 2019 -- a two-year growth rate of as fast as 67% per year.

3 Reasons Mastercard and Visa Are Still Buys,"Since Mastercard Inc. (NYSE:MA) and Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) went public, shareholders have enjoyed returns that have destroyed the S&P 500 index. In May 2006, Mastercard had an initial public offering with the stock valued at a split-adjusted $3.90 per share. Two years later, Visa followed suit and went public at a split-adjusted price of $11 per share. In the past 10 years, Mastercard's and Visa's stocks have almost mirrored each other, returning 685% and 667%, respectively, while crushing the market's return of approximately 100% over the same time span. This incredible growth has not slowed down: Over the past year, Visa has roughly tripled the market's returns, and Mastercard has almost quintupled it!Yet the two companies now sport price-to-earnings multiples worthy of young growth stocks. Based on 2017 non-GAAP earnings per share of $4.59, Mastercard's P/E ratio is close to 38. Similarly, Visa trades at a P/E ratio of almost 33 based on its trailing-12-month adjusted EPS of $3.70.Given the high multiples and the run-up in stock prices, some investors could be tempted to sell now to cash out gains. I don't share that sentiment, however, and think long-term investors will be richly rewarded for holding on to these two companies for years to come. Here are three reasons why:E-commerce on the riseIn the fourth quarter of 2017, e-commerce sales grew $119 billion, a 16.9% increase year over year. Total retail sales rose only 5.7% over the same time, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.When shopping online, 48% of consumers favor using a credit card over any other method of payment, according to the 2017 Total System Services (TSYS) U.S. Consumer Payment Study. The second most popular form of payment for online shopping is debit cards. Both of these payment types overwhelmingly increase the odds that a Mastercard or Visa account will be used to make the purchase.If anything, this trend will only accelerate over time. At the 2017 UBS Global Technology Conference, Visa Chief Financial Officer Vasant Prabhu said the rise of e-commerce makes complete business sense for entrepreneurs:People are not thinking about opening bricks-and-mortar stores if they don't need to, right? So anybody who has a concept of being a merchant and selling your goods and services, initially, almost anywhere in the world today, thinks about doing it in the digital world rather than in the physical world. So there again, so you immediately start with the growth of retail, if you want to call it that. It's clearly biased toward e-commerce to begin with. So that's a phenomenon by itself.Prabhu added that, for online purchases, ""the propensity to use a Visa card is twice as high as [in] a face-to-face transaction.""Payments on the goIt's not just e-commerce that is on the rise, however. Mobile commerce, too, is becoming more popular. Consumers are incorporating their smartphones into their daily lives more than ever before. This includes using them to make purchases in-app and at retailers' checkout counters. In 2017, more consumers than ever before, 66% according to the TSYS payments study, were familiar with making in-app mobile payments. In addition, 44% of consumers used their banking mobile app to pay bills; that's up from 34% just one year ago.Not only that, but 59% of customers made a purchase using a credit card already on file in the app, thus making it easier and more convenient to use this method to shop. That's up from just 46% in 2016, according to TSYS's study.Unsurprisingly, young consumers are most familiar with mobile commerce. In the 18-24 age group, 85% are aware of in-app mobile payments. In the 25-34 age group, that percentage jumps to 88%.Again, this trend can only benefit Mastercard and Visa.Lowered cost of card acceptance around the worldWith the advancement of mobile connectivity around the world, international retailers no longer need expensive equipment and landline access to facilitate card transactions at the point of sale. While this might not matter too much for domestic vendors, it can make a world of difference for merchants in emerging economies.In fact, with QR code technology, retailers can start accepting payments within minutes of downloading an app -- and no equipment is needed beyond a smartphone and a printed QR code.Last month, Mastercard acquired South African mobile-payments start-up Oltio to help facilitate mobile payments in emerging economies. The lowered expense of card acceptance is certainly leading to an increase in card terminals. For instance, India saw more acceptance-point growth in the past year than it did the previous five years combined.The final takeawayLong-term investors in Mastercard and Visa have been richly rewarded, but that doesn't mean the ride is over -- or that it's too late for other investors to partake. The rise of e-commerce is a trend that will only accelerate in the years ahead, and should provide both Mastercard and Visa opportunities to facilitate transactions without competing against cash or checks. As younger consumers use their phones more for in-app purchases, they are charging their 16-digit accounts already saved on file. Finally, with the advance of mobile technology, card and digital acceptance is finally feasible for merchants in emerging economies.These catalysts are already manifesting themselves in the companies' fundamentals. In Mastercard's 2017 fourth quarter, net revenue rose to $3.3 billion, a 20% increase year over year, and adjusted earning per share rose to $1.14, an even more robust 33% increase year over year. These strong numbers were fueled by a 17% increase in switched transactions, the number of purchases made using a Mastercard account.Similarly, Visa saw a 26% increase in adjusted earnings per share powered by a 12% increase in payment volume, the total dollar amount of the purchases made across Visa's network, and a 12% rise in processed transactions.The strong growth and future catalysts all point to years of more market-beating returns ahead.","Since Mastercard Inc.

Mastercard Consumer Control API Eyes Security,"On Monday (Oct. 23), Mastercard announced news of the launch of Mastercard Consumer Control, which allows consumers to view where their credit card information is stored online. The program is an API that displays where payment details are kept, allowing cardholders to understand how that information is being used.‰ÛÏAs digital payments continue to evolve, cardholders have more and more options to enable new types of devices for payment and to pay in new ways online and in-app,‰Ûù said Jessica Turner, executive vice president of Digital Payments & Labs at Mastercard. ‰ÛÏIn our ongoing commitment to deliver consumer-centric solutions, Mastercard is introducing a series of APIs that will give the consumer direct control to view where their card is stored and manage spend across all digital channels ‰ÛÓ all from right within their mobile banking app or website.‰ÛùA recent Mastercard survey indicated that 73 percent of Americans want to manage their credit card information digitally.

What we‰Ûªre really working on is trying to simplify that,‰Ûù said Turner in an interview with PYMNTS. ‰ÛÏWhat we‰Ûªre really going to be focused on is consumer control, connectivity of payments, and this idea of how digital payments, retail and digital come together.‰ÛùMastercard Consumer Control is one of 35 APIs available through the Mastercard Developers portal.

Mastercard Will Now Let You Pay With Blockchain‰ÛÓBut Not Bitcoin,"For the first time, Mastercard is offering the ability to send money over a blockchain rather than by swiping a credit card.After developing its own version of the bitcoin technology over the past couple of years, Mastercard (ma) announced Friday that it is now opening up its blockchain to certain banks and merchants as an alternative‰ÛÓand potentially more efficient‰ÛÓmethod of paying for goods and services.In a sign that mainstream adoption of the technology underpinning cryptocurrency is increasing, Mastercard is the second Fortune 500 company this week to begin facilitating blockchain payments. On Monday, IBM (ibm) revealed that it had also begun processing payments over its own proprietary blockchain between banks in the South Pacific.Like IBM, Mastercard is also targeting cross-border payments between businesses as the primary purpose for its blockchain, which can only be used by invitation. The Mastercard blockchain, however, differs from the tech giant‰Ûªs in an important way: While the IBM blockchain only transmits money in the form of Lumens, a virtual currency created by the non-profit Stellar, Mastercard‰Ûªs blockchain operates independently of a cryptocurrency, and instead accepts payments in traditional local money.‰ÛÏWe are not using a cryptocurrency, and we are not introducing a new cryptocurrency, because that introduces other challenges‰ÛÓregulatory, legal challenges,‰Ûù says Justin Pinkham, a senior vice president at Mastercard Labs, who leads the credit card company‰Ûªs blockchain initiatives. ‰ÛÏIf you do a payment, then what we can do is move those funds in the way that we do today in fiat currency.‰ÛùThat also stands in contrast to the normal ways blockchains have typically been used until now‰ÛÓwhere they act as a ledger of transactions in the specific cryptocurrency to which they were tied, such as bitcoin and Ethereum.On the other hand, Pinkham says, Mastercard has one advantage that the bitcoin blockchain doesn‰Ûªt have: A settlement network that includes 22,000 banks and financial institutions around the world. (IBM has announced 13 banks that it plans to include in its network.) After all, Pinkham adds, companies still predominantly rely on government-issued currency to do business, making it impractical to convert cash into cryptocurrency, or vice versa, for each blockchain payment. ‰ÛÏEven in the bitcoin system you need a bitcoin exchange that could exchange bitcoin for euro, so it creates some complications,‰Ûù Pinkham says.Mastercard hopes to provide the benefits of blockchain technology‰ÛÓincluding a more secure and transparent way of making and tracking payments‰ÛÓwithin the existing financial system, without the hassle of digital currency. ‰ÛÏWhat Mastercard brings to the table here is a unique combination of that blockchain capability and Mastercard‰Ûªs settlement network,‰Ûù Pinkham says. (Rival credit card provider Visa, for its part, has partnered with the blockchain startup Chain to develop its own system for similar business-to-business payments.)For one, businesses could cut costs by using the blockchain to send cross-border payments, which usually pass through several foreign banks on their way overseas, racking up fees along the way. Mastercard‰Ûªs blockchain, however, could cut out those middlemen and connect a purchaser‰Ûªs bank directly to that of the supplier, remitting the payment more efficiently and possibly faster, Pinkham says. (Although the transaction itself will register on the blockchain instantaneously, the funds are still moving through the same system Mastercard uses now, meaning there won‰Ûªt necessarily be an improvement in speed, he cautions.)A number of corporations have already signed up to use Mastercard‰Ûªs blockchain, Pinkham says, though he declined to name any of them. Besides payments, Mastercard envisions that companies could use its blockchain to track the movement of pharmaceuticals as well as luxury goods such as handbags and diamonds, thereby reducing fraud by providing ‰ÛÏproof of provenance.‰ÛùBut consumers won‰Ûªt be able to pay with the Mastercard blockchain instead of plastic, at least not anytime soon, he says. Nor does he see bitcoin as a threat to Mastercard in general. ‰ÛÏQuite frankly, we feel that card payments are simple, safe and easier to use‰ÛÓand better meet the needs of consumers‰ÛÓthan, let‰Ûªs say, a cryptocurrency payment,‰Ûù Pinkham adds.So far, the evidence suggests that‰Ûªs true. Despite the surge in the bitcoin price, which hit a new record surpassing $5800 last week, the number of major online retailers accepting payment in bitcoin dropped to just three this year, compared to 483 who accept Mastercard and Visa, according to Morgan Stanley.This article is part of Fortune‰Ûªs new initiative, The Ledger, a trusted news source at the intersection of tech and finance.

This gauge is crucial in determining whether investors are moved toward the direction of buying more of the stock, or else doing the contradictory side and selling more of the stock. This is very important directional information necessary for making trading decisions.Whereas for long term intention, measuring performance with long timeframe can help for taking more accurate investment decision that includes quarter, semi-annual and annual performance.

Mastercard‰Ûªs New Blockchain Is Interesting Because of What It Leaves Out,"The credit card giant has given blockchain technology a big push toward the mainstream. Mastercard says its newly released API can immediately help banks and other businesses make payments across international borders faster at less cost. The move follows a similar one by IBM, which just launched its own cross-border payment system for nations in the South Pacific.One big difference, though: Mastercard‰Ûªs system won‰Ûªt involve any cryptocurrency. It will handle the ‰ÛÏclearing‰Ûù of financial transactions‰ÛÓthe process by which account balances are updated to reflect new transactions‰ÛÓand will register these updates on a distributed ledger. (See ‰ÛÏWhy Bitcoin Could Be Much More Than a Currency.‰Ûù) The actual transfer of money, known as the settlement, will use Mastercard‰Ûªs conventional system, based on local fiat currencies.IBM‰Ûªs system will settle transactions by having its proprietary blockchain work in tandem with a second one, built by a nonprofit called Stellar. Stellar‰Ûªs cryptocurrency, Lumens, will serve as the unit of value transferred between parties.What does it all mean? Mostly, it means it‰Ûªs still early. IBM‰Ûªs new payment system may use Stellar‰Ûªs currency only temporarily; the company is eyeing an eventual transition to government-backed cryptocurrencies. It‰Ûªs not clear when that will happen, though as I‰Ûªve recently reported, a number of central banks are testing this idea.","The move follows a similar one by IBM, which just launched its own cross-border payment system for nations in the South Pacific.One big difference, though: Mastercard‰Ûªs system won‰Ûªt involve any cryptocurrency.IBM‰Ûªs system will settle transactions by having its proprietary blockchain work in tandem with a second one, built by a nonprofit called Stellar.Stellar‰Ûªs cryptocurrency, Lumens, will serve as the unit of value transferred between parties.IBM‰Ûªs new payment system may use Stellar‰Ûªs currency only temporarily; the company is eyeing an eventual transition to government-backed cryptocurrencies.","['cryptocurrency', 'banks', 'blockchain', 'system', 'work', 'currency', 'mastercards', 'leaves', 'stellars', 'payment', 'big', 'interesting']",,,[],,https://www.technologyreview.com/the-download/609212/mastercards-new-blockchain-is-interesting-because-of-what-it-leaves-out/,,,,
Maybe This Will Allow Ripple XRP To Take Over Visa And Mastercard,"We always hear rumours of Ripple and Visa/Mastercard, this is most probably because at it stands, Ripple‰Ûªs technology seems to be the most adoptable by mainstream society and that therefore, if a cryptocurrency did some to the fore against Visa and Mastercard, it would most probably be through Ripple and XRP.In a press release on PRNewswire, yesterday we saw an announcement from Modern Finance Chain (or MF Chain) who have produced a new application that has been designed to offer a direct and ready to use alternative service for payment facilitation to Mastercard and Visa. You can see the press release for yourself, here- https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/crypto-company-launches-app-aimed-to-replace-visa-mastercard-payments-300651824.htmlOkay, so there‰Ûªs no mention of Ripple or XRP here, however as I have already mentioned, if MF Chain wanted to work with a ready made company and a ready made currency, we imagine XRP might be the top of their list.According to MF Chain:‰ÛÏMF Chain is simple, sleek and intuitive to use. Ensuring ease of integration and merchant adoption was top of mind for the MF Chain development team. Once merchants create and have their account verified, their ability to process payments and begin earning 1% crypto-back is ready for use.‰Ûù‰ÛÏTaking payments is just as simple. Once the final amount to be paid is determined, merchants simply enter in the total amount (after any applicable taxes), the MF Chain app converts the cash amount entered into the correlating amount in all cryptocurrencies supported. By simply selecting the crypto the consumer wishes to use, a QR code is displayed for consumers to scan and complete the payment process.‰ÛùAs it stands, there is no real information on the surface about which currencies will be integrated within this system. Of course, replacing Visa and Mastercard is a colossal task, but the team behind MF Chain do seem to be driven to do so. Fair play to them.It is likely that upon a full launch, MF Chain will focus on Bitcoin, at least for the main roll out, however XRP still rings as a currency with some really useful applications here. The only stumbling block they may come across, is a conflict of interest between MF Chains network and of course, Ripples xCurrent, xRapid and xVia. MF Chain are unlikely to adopt Ripple‰Ûªs services, so really, is an XRP listing likely, who knows?In the real pursuit to outsmart Visa and Mastercard, XRP will play an important role, wherever it may be. For MF Chain to real succeed here, let‰Ûªs hope that somehow, XRP will come to the fore.","Ensuring ease of integration and merchant adoption was top of mind for the MF Chain development team.Of course, replacing Visa and Mastercard is a colossal task, but the team behind MF Chain do seem to be driven to do so.MF Chain are unlikely to adopt Ripple‰Ûªs services, so really, is an XRP listing likely, who knows?In the real pursuit to outsmart Visa and Mastercard, XRP will play an important role, wherever it may be.For MF Chain to real succeed here, let‰Ûªs hope that somehow, XRP will come to the fore.","['visa', 'xrp', 'ready', 'ripple', 'allow', 'chain', 'real', 'maybe', 'team', 'mastercard', 'ripples', 'mf']",,,"['Thomas Ramsay', 'Thomas Has Led A Number Of Teams', 'Giving Training', 'Guidance In Marketing', 'Pr.

Mastercard Caters to the 'New Middle Class',"Welcome to the middle class! Congratulations, you made it! Good luck getting approved for a credit card with that low or nonexistent credit score, though.Traditional lenders may not use this exact phrasing, but the sentiment might as well be on the cover of the brochure for new middle-class life. Whether an applicant has recently immigrated and lacks the background data to be approved, or is recovering from a drastic life event such as a divorce or death of a spouse, demonstrating their creditworthiness is often impossible by traditional means ‰ÛÒ i.e. the FICO score ‰ÛÒ leaving as many as 160 million Americans up the creek with no paddle.Mastercard is one company that‰Ûªs working to build and provide paddles to those thin-file, non-prime borrowers, creating an on-ramp for them to join the mainstream economy.Sherri Haymond, EVP of digital partnerships at Mastercard, told Karen Webster during a recent interview that the company‰Ûªs recent partnership with Fort Worth-based Elevate Credit Inc. will help further this mission.‰ÛÏ160 million Americans have low or no credit scores,‰Ûù Haymond said. ‰ÛÏThat‰Ûªs a huge part of our economy. Our philosophy is that bringing people into the economic framework and giving them access to financial literacy and tools helps everyone. It helps the economy as a whole when more people participate in a meaningful way.‰ÛùPast History With the New Middle ClassHaymond said Mastercard has already put its philosophy into practice by partnering with CreditStacks, a FinTech that focuses on providing credit to new Americans, as well as launching its Inclusive Futures Project in December 2017 to address the needs of gig and on-demand workers. The company also continually invests in research and programs at its Center for Inclusive Growth.Funnily enough, Haymond said, Elevate has its own center similar to Mastercard‰Ûªs. Elevate‰Ûªs center focuses specifically on the ‰ÛÏNew Middle Class,‰Ûù a growing cohort of productive yet credit-constrained Americans with credit scores lower than 700 and little to no savings. Without access to traditional credit, the New Middle Class tends to be limited to more expensive forms of credit, leaving them with few options to meet immediate financial needs.‰ÛÏA key issue for America‰Ûªs non-prime population is income volatility,‰Ûù Elevate CEO Ken Rees said in a press release announcing the partnership with Mastercard. ‰ÛÏAccessing a traditional credit product with real buying power will allow them the opportunity to smooth their financial ups and downs.‰ÛùIncome volatility is at the heart of Mastercard‰Ûªs Inclusive Futures Project, Haymond noted. The people who benefit most from the project are often juggling multiple jobs, challenging schedules and resultantly irregular income streams.Mastercard Meets ElevateSome of the features of the new product will include purchase and fraud alerts, credit score monitoring, a full-service mobile app and on/off functionality for the credit card. Cards will be awarded based on the analysis of data from alternative sources, Haymond said, which can fill in the blanks to evaluate a customer‰Ûªs creditworthiness when traditional data points are not present or don‰Ûªt meet requirements.Webster noted that people often want to understand how to be better with their money, and a tool like this could help them do that ‰ÛÒ but people also don‰Ûªt want to be told what to do with their money. It could be a tricky balance to strike, she commented.Haymond said that Mastercard‰Ûªs goal with the Elevate partnership ‰ÛÒ and with its own pursuits in this area ‰ÛÒ is to give people tools and empower them. It‰Ûªs not the same as nagging someone to spend more carefully or establish savings, she said ‰ÛÒ yet providing the right tools can absolutely have those outcomes, enabling struggling consumers to develop the good habits they want to learn.Once the feedback loop kicks in, it enables consumers to become self-aware about their financial habits. If spending X caused Y to happen, the customer can develop new habits around that type of spending. Haymond said that just seeing the consequences spelled out in front of them, as the Mastercard/Elevate product will enable, can be enough to set people on the right track without telling them what to do.‰ÛÏDigital provides those tools in a private and transparent way,‰Ûù Haymond said. ‰ÛÏWith continual credit monitoring, you can see the effects of your score going up ‰ÛÒ and that‰Ûªs positive reinforcement.‰ÛùHaymond said Elevate is working with a bank partner to develop the new credit product, but the partner‰Ûªs name has not yet been disclosed. Both the partner and the product are set to be unveiled sometime in 2018, she said.","Good luck getting approved for a credit card with that low or nonexistent credit score, though.Sherri Haymond, EVP of digital partnerships at Mastercard, told Karen Webster during a recent interview that the company‰Ûªs recent partnership with Fort Worth-based Elevate Credit Inc. will help further this mission.Elevate‰Ûªs center focuses specifically on the ‰ÛÏNew Middle Class,‰Ûù a growing cohort of productive yet credit-constrained Americans with credit scores lower than 700 and little to no savings.Without access to traditional credit, the New Middle Class tends to be limited to more expensive forms of credit, leaving them with few options to meet immediate financial needs.Mastercard Meets ElevateSome of the features of the new product will include purchase and fraud alerts, credit score monitoring, a full-service mobile app and on/off functionality for the credit card.","['tools', 'middle', 'product', 'elevate', 'score', 'financial', 'caters', 'class', 'haymond', 'traditional', 'credit', 'mastercard', 'americans']",,,[],2018-04-27 04:02:32+00:00,https://www.pymnts.com/financial-inclusion-3/2018/new-middle-class-financial-inclusion-mastercard-elevate/,,,,
National Bank of Kuwait and Mastercard make GCC debut of pioneering biometric solutions,"Answering the market‰Ûªs growing demand for increased convenience and security associated with biometric technology, National Bank of Kuwait and Mastercard announced two pioneering biometric solutions designed to improve online and in-store shopping at a press conference held at NBK Head.Identity Check offers an innovative authentication solution for online transactions, while biometric card features an embedded fingerprint sensor to provide an additional layer of security when making payments in-storeIsam Al-Sager, NBK's Group Chief Executive Officer, said: ‰ÛÏOur long-standing partnership with MasterCard enables us today to introduce the most advanced and first of its kind service in the Middle East, allowing customers to use the Selfie Pay service as well as biometric cards. These new services come in line with NBK‰Ûªs endeavors to offer the latest technologies in the banking sector as demand for easier and safer banking services continue to increase.‰ÛùMr. Isam J. Al-Sager, Group Chief Executive Officer, National Bank of Kuwait, National Bank of Kuwait, and Mr. Mohammed Al Othman, General Manager of Consumer Banking Group, National Bank of Kuwait attended the event. Mr. Khalid Elgibali, Division President ‰ÛÒ Middle East and North Africa represented Mastercard at the event which started with the announcement of the new biometric solutions and was followed by a showcase at NBK museum. Journalists were invited to test drive the Identity Check online authentication solution along with other innovative banking technologies NBK has introduced including Video Chat, Quick Pay, Ask Me and the advanced Online Banking and Mobile Banking app services.AdvertisementAl-Sager added: ‰ÛÏWe continue to focus on bringing innovative and unique services to our NBK customers through our partnerships with leading and internationally renowned companies such MasterCard. Leading the way with technologically advanced services is a strategy that falls in line with our long-term strategy to improving mobile services that satisfy the needs of our customers.‰ÛùNBK customers will be the first in the Middle East and Africa (MEA) region to experience Mastercard‰Ûªs Identity Check online authentication solution, while a pilot program for an innovative biometric card with an embedded fingerprint sensor will be a first for the GCC.Mastercard Identity Check is an advanced authentication solution that uses biometric identifiers such as fingerprint, facial and voice recognition to verify users‰Ûª identity through their mobile devices when shopping and banking online. The solution works across multiple devices and platforms, simplifying consumers‰Ûª lives by eliminating the need to enter a password or answer security questions.Following the official launch, the Mastercard and NBK co-branded app, ‰Û÷Mastercard Identity Check for NBK ‰Ûª, will be available from the Apple App Store and Google Play Store. Consumers can download the application and register their biometrics ‰ÛÒ whether fingerprint or face ‰ÛÒ securely on the smartphone.Once registered, users will receive a notification through the app prompting them to authenticate their identity using their preferred choice of biometrics to complete the transaction when making online purchases.National Bank of Kuwait and MasterCard also announced the GCC region‰Ûªs first pilot program for a biometric card to conveniently and safely verify the cardholder‰Ûªs identity for in-store purchases. When shopping and paying in-store, the biometric card works like any other chip card. The cardholder simply dips the card into a retailer‰Ûªs point-of-sale terminal while placing their finger on the embedded sensor. The fingerprint is verified against the template stored on the card and ‰ÛÒ if the biometrics matches ‰ÛÒ the transaction can then be approved with the card never leaving the consumer‰Ûªs hand.The biometric card works with existing EMV card terminals globally, so cardholders can use it wherever cards are accepted, without any new hardware or software upgrades required from merchants.Mr. Dimitrios Kokosioulis, Head of IT & Operations Group, National Bank of Kuwait commented: ‰ÛÏNBK endeavors to deliver innovative, powerful and distinctive value propositions to our consumers. Working with Mastercard, we are introducing solutions in the region for the very first time, meaning our customers can experience the latest and most advanced authentication technology available today. The adoption of this technology is also fully aligned with our ‰Û÷mobile-first strategy‰Ûª, which outlines a roadmap to a more convenient future for our customers.‰Ûù‰ÛÏWe are excited to build on our long-standing partnership with NBK as we debut groundbreaking biometric technology in the region for the very first time. Our joint research with the University of Oxford has proven that 93% of consumers prefer using biometrics to remembering passwords. These next-generation authentication solutions are no longer based on what you remember, but who you are ‰ÛÒ a fundamental difference that brings new levels of convenience to consumers, while further enhancing security. The development of these innovative solutions marks an important step in our ongoing quest to fulfill the needs of consumers and drive change across the region‰Ûªs constantly evolving payments ecosystem,‰Ûù said Khalid Elgibali, Division President, MENA, Mastercard.-Ends-For more info, please contact Media Relations Manager Ms. Safa‰Ûªa Al Matari on:Telephone: 22592789Mobile: 97660001Email 1: SafaELMatari@nbk.com ;Email 2: NBKMediaRelations@nbk.com ;å© Press Release 2018","Answering the market‰Ûªs growing demand for increased convenience and security associated with biometric technology, National Bank of Kuwait and Mastercard announced two pioneering biometric solutions designed to improve online and in-store shopping at a press conference held at NBK Head.Following the official launch, the Mastercard and NBK co-branded app, ‰Û÷Mastercard Identity Check for NBK ‰Ûª, will be available from the Apple App Store and Google Play Store.National Bank of Kuwait and MasterCard also announced the GCC region‰Ûªs first pilot program for a biometric card to conveniently and safely verify the cardholder‰Ûªs identity for in-store purchases.When shopping and paying in-store, the biometric card works like any other chip card.The biometric card works with existing EMV card terminals globally, so cardholders can use it wherever cards are accepted, without any new hardware or software upgrades required from merchants.","['card', 'biometric', 'identity', 'innovative', 'kuwait', 'gcc', 'national', 'bank', 'solutions', 'consumers', 'pioneering', 'mastercard', 'online', 'banking', 'debut', 'nbk']",,,['Press Release'],,https://www.zawya.com/mena/en/story/National_Bank_of_Kuwait_and_Mastercard_make_GCC_debut_of_pioneering_biometric_solutions-ZAWYA20180514123958/,,,,

The price-to-sales ratio offers a simple approach in this case. They just need to take the company‰Ûªs market capitalization and divide it by the company‰Ûªs total sales over the past 12 months. The lesser the ratio, the more attractive the investment. During the key period of last 5 years, Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) sales have annually surged 11.10% on average, however its earnings per share growth remained at 14.80%.Dividends is a reward scheme, that a company presents to its shareholders.

Now a days one of the fundamental indicator used in the technical analysis is called Stochastic %D‰Ûù, Stochastic indicator was created by George Lane. The stochastic is a momentum indicator comparing the closing price of a security to the range of its prices over a fix period of time. The gauge is based on the assumption that if price surges, the closing price tends towards the values that belong to the upper part of the area of price movements in the preceding period. On the other hand if price drops, the contrary is right. For Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), Stochastic %D value stayed at 93.72% for the last 9 days.

Its most recent closing price has a distance of 0.81% from SMA20 and is -2.78% below than SMA200.Investors generally keep an extensive variety of technical indicators at their disposal for completing technical stock analysis. The average true range is a moving average, generally 14 days, of the true ranges.The average true range (ATR) was fashioned to allow traders to more precisely evaluate the daily volatility of an asset by using straightforward calculations. However the indicator does not specify the price direction, rather it is used first and foremost to measure volatility caused by gaps and limit up or down moves. The ATR is fairly simple to calculate and only needs historical price data.ATR is counted for different periods, like 9-day, 14-day, 20-day, 50-day and 100-day.

"Exclusive Q&A With Mastercard Exec: Expanding Payment To Wearables, VR And Smart Home Devices","Del Valle, who will be presenting the session, titled Transforming How People Pay: Commerce For Every Device at next week‰Ûªs Retail Innovation Conference , April 30-May 2 in New York City, revealed why payment providers need to balance innovation, consumer convenience and data security within a rapidly shifting customer journey.Payments are the unglamorous but absolutely necessary piece of any consumer purchase. As retail touch points have multiplied and become more technologically complex, encompassing mobile devices, wearables, and now voice, AR and VR applications, payment providers have had to keep pace. One indication of the breadth of this challenge is in Kiki Del Valle‰Ûªs title: she is SVP of Commerce for Every Device at Mastercard.Retail TouchPoints (RTP): How are the changes that are taking place in the customer journey affecting payment processes?Kiki Del Valle: In the discovery, learning and comparison phases that ultimately lead to a purchase, knowledge is being used in different ways. For example, 85% of people use a mobile device while browsing, although not necessarily while buying. There are now a number of devices consumers are using to build an open cart, and additionally consumers want to be able to do this at any given moment, 24/7. So we‰Ûªre looking at ways that allow consumers to pay in new forms, including not just smartphones but with wearables and smart devices in homes and vehicles.ADVERTISEMENTAdditionally, the in-store discovery process will continue to undergo major transformations. Technology including Internet of Things (IoT) devices, sensors, beacons, digital signage, tablet-based POS systems and RFID systems all will help in completing the commerce journey.Where payment processes in general and Mastercard come in is to enable and build a bridge between the physical and the digital. We‰Ûªre looking to lay the foundations for payments to occur across all these different experiences ‰ÛÓ in-store, online, even via augmented reality (AR) or virtual reality (VR). Payment should happen in a standard, seamless way, and with the same level of security that you‰Ûªve come to expect from Mastercard.RTP: What are some specific things Mastercard is doing to help merchants redefine the commerce experience?Del Valle: In the retail store environment, we‰Ûªve partnered with AVA Retail to provide retailers with the same level of analytics in-store that are available online. In addition to learning what consumers ultimately buy, the technology can show where these shoppers spent their time and what they are browsing in the store. We have used this type of AVA partnership with a Fred Segal pop-up shop.We‰Ûªve also jointly developed a chatbot with Subway that lets consumers ‰ÛÏbuild a cart‰Ûù while leveraging Facebook Messaging. It‰Ûªs meant to parallel the conversation with a Subway artist in the store, as I tell him I want a six-inch turkey sandwich on wheat bread with lettuce and mustard. That interaction is very much conversational, and so we built the chatbot to facilitate that.RTP: How do you see payment integrating with newer technologies such as AR and VR?Del Valle: AR and VR give merchants the ability to bring experiences into the customer‰Ûªs home, or show them goods that aren‰Ûªt available for purchase in a specific physical location. We‰Ûªve seen them take off in the furniture and home furnishings categories, allowing people to see what a sofa actually looks like in the room where the customer will use it.Swarovski is using a home VR app that allows consumers to be fully immersed in a completely decorated home. They can see the pieces like sculptures and chandeliers. What we‰Ûªre doing here is facilitating payment via Masterpass, so the user doesn‰Ûªt have to put the VR device aside when they are ready to make a purchase. It‰Ûªs not only a convenience, it also drives higher conversion rates.RTP: What are the biggest security concerns as payment spreads to all these different devices?Del Valle: Security is critical for Mastercard, and we believe that security and the innovation that allows for increased convenience absolutely can work together. You don‰Ûªt have to sacrifice one to get the other. The way we‰Ûªre securing innovation is using globally adopted standards, like the second-generation standards from EMVCo and the PIN-on-glass standards from the PCI Council. We‰Ûªre also using tokenization to protect consumers‰Ûª card data from fraud, while also addressing threats from cyberattacks and hacking.Another thing we‰Ûªre doing is leveraging AI and machine learning to make sure that every transaction that flows through our network is secure. AI is increasingly being deployed to look at new data points, and we‰Ûªre embedding it with our own decision intelligence. Through acquisitions we‰Ûªve made, such as NuData, we also can use behavioral-based identification. This looks at the way a consumer uses his or her mobile device ‰ÛÓ how fast they are typing, the mistakes they make ‰ÛÓ to try to assess if the person is who they say they are.Ultimately we want to get rid of passwords in favor of biometrics, because a password is something you know rather than something you are. We want to double down on efforts to use biometric identifiers like fingerprints, the irises in your eye or your voice to speed up checkout and help the consumer without compromising the safety of the transaction.Later this year, we‰Ûªll be introducing consumer control APIs that allow consumers to have better visibility into where their Mastercard credentials are stored. Consumers may have a card on file with a merchant that they don‰Ûªt transact with that often, or on a number of different devices. These APIs would allow consumers to put a hold on an individual token or a certain account, whether at the device level or the merchant level. They could even delete their cards from a merchant‰Ûªs mobile banking location altogether.RTP: What do you see as the most important trends in retail payments heading into 2019?Del Valle: There are a lot of different trends reshaping payments and commerce, but the three biggest I see are:‰Û¢ Increased use of AI, not just for backend processes like operations, inventory and fraud prevention but in the context of conversational commerce. AI allows for hyperpersonalization with the use of real-time predictive analytics, using multiple data points, including a shopper‰Ûªs past interactions with the brand, to personalize the content they see.‰Û¢ Growth of IoT. We want to make sure we continue to evolve with the way consumers are making and receiving payments, because that‰Ûªs no longer defined solely by a card.‰Û¢ The growth of the gig economy. There‰Ûªs a study by Intuit saying that 40% of American workers will be independent contractors by the year 2020. The evolution of this model means that every consumer becomes a merchant, so they will need to accept payments as well as make them. We‰Ûªre looking at real-time payment solutions for those independent workers that will be building the gig economy.Catch Kiki Del Valle‰Ûªs session at the Retail Innovation Conference, April 30-May 2 in New York City.","As retail touch points have multiplied and become more technologically complex, encompassing mobile devices, wearables, and now voice, AR and VR applications, payment providers have had to keep pace.Payment should happen in a standard, seamless way, and with the same level of security that you‰Ûªve come to expect from Mastercard.Swarovski is using a home VR app that allows consumers to be fully immersed in a completely decorated home.What we‰Ûªre doing here is facilitating payment via Masterpass, so the user doesn‰Ûªt have to put the VR device aside when they are ready to make a purchase.Del Valle: Security is critical for Mastercard, and we believe that security and the innovation that allows for increased convenience absolutely can work together.","['using', 'qa', 'wearables', 'mastercard', 'valle', 'retail', 'commerce', 'devices', 'exclusive', 'smart', 'exec', 'device', 'consumer', 'expanding', 'consumers', 'payment', 'vr', 'security']",,,['Adam Blair'],,https://www.retailtouchpoints.com/features/trend-watch/exclusive-q-a-with-mastercard-exec-expanding-payment-to-wearables-vr-and-smart-home-devices,,,,

Mastercard Says Final Goodbye To The Signature,"Tomorrow, April 13, signing a receipt at the end of a Mastercard credit or debit transaction at the physical POS will become a relic of payments history. Mastercard first announced its plan to go sans signature six months ago.It‰Ûªs a change that‰Ûªs long overdue for many consumers.Consumers like Karen Webster, who ‰ÛÒ in a conversation with Mastercard U.S. market development EVP Linda Kirkpatrick ‰ÛÒ shared a coffee shop anecdote about waiting in line behind someone who whipped out her debit card to pay for a $2.30 transaction ‰Û_ and had to sign.‰ÛÏI mean, it could have been slower,‰Ûù Webster remarked, ‰ÛÏbut it would have required paying her check in pennies.‰ÛùKirkpatrick agreed rather wholeheartedly, noting that Webster was far from the only person who feels that way. As it turns out, there is no love lost for the signature at the POS.In any given year, she noted, Mastercard announces a variety of changes, initiatives and adjustments to policy. They hear a lot, and often, from their issuer and merchant partners ‰ÛÒ which makes sense, given their B2B orientation ‰ÛÒ but generally don‰Ûªt hear as much from consumers directly.This change, she noted, was very much the exception.‰ÛÏWe don‰Ûªt normally see an influx of consumer feedback directly,‰Ûù Kirkpatrick said, ‰ÛÏbut this time, we got a massive wave of tweets and Instagram posts on people celebrating the end of the signature. We really had no idea people were so passionate about getting rid of it.‰ÛùHow Has It Held on So Long?That extra few seconds at the end of a transaction has long been an annoyance, Kirkpatrick said ‰ÛÒ but for a while, it was one with a purpose. In a pre-EMV world, she noted, there were chargeback codes that actually relied on having signatures on a merchant receipt in the event of a dispute.Although those codes were rarely used, they had a definite purpose in a small range of cases when there was a dispute between the merchant and the issuer that needed to be arbitrated by the card network. And because there was a defined (if rare) use case, and because the inconvenience of having a customer sign a slip was basically small for everyone involved, it made sense to have customers sign for transactions, regardless.As Kirkpatrick said, there were exceptions, namely at the behest of the QSR community. Requiring a signature for the large volume of low-dollar transactions slowed things down, so the rules were changed to waive them for purchases under $25.‰ÛÏThe QSRs are really advanced in the no signature path,‰Ûù she noted ‰ÛÒ and it‰Ûªs the market segment that‰Ûªs most looking forward to Mastercard‰Ûªs full shutdown on Friday.And, Kirkpatrick pointed out, as retail has evolved and EMV has become the ruling standard in the U.S. market over the last two-and-a-half years ‰ÛÒ along with the advance of various digital payments technologies, like tokenization ‰ÛÒ the signature has lived past its purpose, from Mastercard‰Ûªs point of view.‰ÛÏThere is no scenario in an EMV environment where a signature can rectify a chargeback. We are just at an inflection point that has been brought on by all of the advances of the last few years, where we have things like biometrics and tokens that have just fully eclipsed the signature,‰Ûù Kirkpatrick observed.Hitting the ‰Û÷Off Switch‰ÛªSo, without a use case, Kirkpatrick noted, all there is left with the signature is the annoying friction that it can impose on consumers and merchants.On the customer side of things, that means moving beyond something that has clearly become as outdated as a paper check.According to a ‰ÛÏSignature Retirement‰Ûù survey Mastercard commissioned in honor of the grand closing of signing on a transaction, signatures are already moving into the rearview mirror for a majority of Americans ‰ÛÒ about 20 percent can‰Ûªt even remember the last time they signed for a purchase.‰ÛÏEven now, and without the wholesale waiving of the signature requirement, 80 percent of purchases are already eligible to be signature-free,‰Ûù Kirkpatrick told Webster.But when they do hit a signature requirement, they don‰Ûªt like it at all. About 71 percent get annoyed if the person in line ahead of them has to stop and sign on a small transaction. Millennials particularly don‰Ûªt like being asked to sign for things, since they really, really don‰Ûªt like writing in cursive.On the merchant side, she noted, it‰Ûªs about giving retailers of all descriptions the ability to offer and checkout transaction flow that makes sense given the specific needs of their business.Some retailers, she noted, might actually hold onto the signature phase of the purchase for reasons outside of the chargeback process, which Kirkpatrick said is perfectly fine. There are circumstances, she observed, where certain merchants ‰ÛÒ particularly with jewelry stores and electronics vendors ‰ÛÒ want to be able to put their own security protocols in place.As for the consumers, who raved so cheerfully in October at the news that the signatures were going away for good, Karen Webster asked, will they notice that they‰Ûªve suddenly almost all gone by the wayside?Hard to say, Kirkpatrick noted, since consumers don‰Ûªt always notice a good experience with the same consistency as they notice the bad ones. They might just go on with their commerce lives, blissfully unaware of the improvement on a conscious level. They probably won‰Ûªt even say ‰ÛÏthank you.‰ÛùBut if it drives them to transact more, or build bigger baskets because subconsciously they know they won‰Ûªt have a little roadblock to jump over at the end ‰ÛÒ well, that‰Ûªs an excellent thank-you as far as Mastercard‰Ûªs issuers and merchants are concerned.","Mastercard first announced its plan to go sans signature six months ago.In any given year, she noted, Mastercard announces a variety of changes, initiatives and adjustments to policy.Hitting the ‰Û÷Off Switch‰ÛªSo, without a use case, Kirkpatrick noted, all there is left with the signature is the annoying friction that it can impose on consumers and merchants.Millennials particularly don‰Ûªt like being asked to sign for things, since they really, really don‰Ûªt like writing in cursive.Hard to say, Kirkpatrick noted, since consumers don‰Ûªt always notice a good experience with the same consistency as they notice the bad ones.","['really', 'dont', 'signature', 'transaction', 'sign', 'noted', 'webster', 'goodbye', 'things', 'final', 'mastercard', 'kirkpatrick']",,,[],2018-04-12 04:02:11+00:00,https://www.pymnts.com/mastercard/2018/mastercard-signature-emv-credit-cards-pos/,,,,

IFC and Mastercard Expand Partnership to Drive Greater Financial Inclusion in Emerging Markets,"Mastercard and IFC, a member of the World Bank Group, today bolstered their partnership to drive financial inclusion, updating a $250 million global risk-sharing facility to expand access to electronic payments in emerging markets.This press release features multimedia.

(Photo: Business Wire)Electronic payments help underserved people and small businesses more fully participate in the formal economy. Yet, financial institutions in emerging markets often have difficulty covering their transaction settlement obligations, making it harder to rapidly scale financial services where they are needed most.Updating an agreement originally signed in 2015, the revised agreement between IFC and Mastercard helps financial institutions in developing countries participate in the Mastercard network more effectively through a program in which IFC will guarantee up to 100 percent of the settlement risk. The new agreement will support a major expansion of the program to more participating banks and financial institutions.Stephanie von Friedeburg, IFC chief operating officer said, ‰ÛÏThis partnership will help bring modern financial services to underserved people around the world. It allows us to pool our capabilities in risk management and financial technologies, and to leverage our global network of financial institutions to deliver financial inclusion.‰ÛùWith the revised agreement, Mastercard will extend its efforts to identify, develop and implement programs with participating financial institutions. This will improve access to electronic payments for millions of people in emerging markets. The company will also continue to support a separate 2016 agreement with IFC to increase acceptance of electronic payments among small businesses and micro entrepreneurs in the same markets.‰ÛÏTrue inclusion is not something any one entity can deliver on its own,‰Ûù said Michael Froman, vice chairman and president, strategic growth at Mastercard. ‰ÛÏIt‰Ûªs partnerships like this, combined with technology and know-how, that are truly driving greater inclusion in emerging markets. The programs the facility is developing around the world are vital to bringing people and communities into the financial system and on a path to prosperity.‰ÛùMastercard‰Ûªs broader work with the World Bank Group is helping to increase universal financial access by 2020. In 2015, the company committed to reach 500 million people previously excluded from financial services within five years. Today, the company has connected more than 330 million people around the world through programs like the Mastercard-IFC public-private partnership, with more to come.About IFCIFC, a member of the World Bank Group, is the largest global development institution focused on the private sector in emerging markets. Working with more than 2,000 businesses worldwide, we use our capital, expertise, and influence, to create opportunity where it‰Ûªs needed most.

Should You Expect Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) To Continue Delivering An ROE Of 74.56%?,"With an ROE of 74.56%, Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) outpaced its own industry which delivered a less exciting 15.23% over the past year. However, whether this above-industry ROE is actually impressive depends on if it can be maintained. A measure of sustainable returns is MA‰Ûªs financial leverage. If MA borrows debt to invest in its business, its profits will be higher. But ROE does not capture any debt, so we only see high profits and low equity, which is great on the surface. But today let‰Ûªs take a deeper dive below this surface. Check out our latest analysis for MastercardBreaking down ROE ‰ÛÓ the mother of all ratiosReturn on Equity (ROE) weighs Mastercard‰Ûªs profit against the level of its shareholders‰Ûª equity. An ROE of 74.56% implies $0.75 returned on every $1 invested, so the higher the return, the better. If investors diversify their portfolio by industry, they may want to maximise their return in the Data Processing and Outsourced Services sector by investing in the highest returning stock. However, this can be deceiving as each company has varying costs of equity and debt levels, which could exaggeratedly push up ROE at the same time as accumulating high interest expense.Return on Equity = Net Profit Ìá Shareholders EquityROE is measured against cost of equity in order to determine the efficiency of Mastercard‰Ûªs equity capital deployed. Its cost of equity is 9.34%. Given a positive discrepancy of 65.22% between return and cost, this indicates that Mastercard pays less for its capital than what it generates in return, which is a sign of capital efficiency. ROE can be split up into three useful ratios: net profit margin, asset turnover, and financial leverage. This is called the Dupont Formula:Dupont Formula ROE = profit margin ÌÑ asset turnover ÌÑ financial leverage ROE = (annual net profit Ìá sales) ÌÑ (sales Ìá assets) ÌÑ (assets Ìá shareholders‰Ûª equity) ROE = annual net profit Ìá shareholders‰Ûª equityThe first component is profit margin, which measures how much of sales is retained after the company pays for all its expenses. Asset turnover reveals how much revenue can be generated from Mastercard‰Ûªs asset base. Finally, financial leverage will be our main focus today. It shows how much of assets are funded by equity and can show how sustainable the company‰Ûªs capital structure is. We can determine if Mastercard‰Ûªs ROE is inflated by borrowing high levels of debt. Generally, a balanced capital structure means its returns will be sustainable over the long run. We can examine this by looking at Mastercard‰Ûªs debt-to-equity ratio. The ratio currently stands at a balanced 111.50%, meaning Mastercard has not taken on excessively disproportionate debt to drive its returns. The company is able to produce profit growth without a substantial debt burden.Next Steps:ROE is one of many ratios which meaningfully dissects financial statements, which illustrates the quality of a company. Mastercard exhibits a strong ROE against its peers, as well as sufficient returns to cover its cost of equity. Its high ROE is not likely to be driven by high debt. Therefore, investors may have more confidence in the sustainability of this level of returns going forward. ROE is a helpful signal, but it is definitely not sufficient on its own to make an investment decision.For Mastercard, I‰Ûªve put together three pertinent aspects you should look at:Financial Health: Does it have a healthy balance sheet?

Mastercard Paces 3 Buy-Zone Stocks; 2 With Triple-Digit EPS Views,"Three IBD Stock Spotlight names were in buy range, above buy points on Friday. Two of those stocks, Enanta (ENTA) and Ring Central (RNG), have earnings due in the coming week.XThe bigger name, Mastercard (MA), on Friday was trading up more than 6% over the last five sessions. That marked its strongest week since a 13% advance broke the stock out of a 10-month consolidation in October 2014.The credit payment processor on Wednesday reported a third straight quarter of accelerating growth. At least three analysts ratcheted price targets higher after the results.Mastercard shares traded 2% above a flat base buy point at 183.83 on Friday. The base is a second-stage pattern. That says, among other things, that the breakout carries less risk of failure than a later stage base would.Stocks With Triple-Digit EPS Estimates: Enanta, Ring CentralEnanta is a small cap biotech focused on developing drugs for liver disease and viral infections. It partners primarily with AbbVie (ABBV), and collects royalties on the antiviral drug glecaprevir, used in AbbVie's successful hepatitis C treatment, Mavyret. The company directs nearly 56% of revenue back into R&D, working to broaden its pipeline.The debt-free drugmaker will run up against stiff expectations when it reports after Tuesday close.

Mastercard vs Visa : qui remportera la bataille des fintechs ?,"Quel est le point commun entre N26, Compte-Nickel ou encore Treezor ? Ces nouveaux acteurs du paiement ont tous misÌ© sur Mastercard. Un choix plutÌ«t Ì©tonnant car, en France, les cartes Visa sont plus rÌ©pandues... BNP Paribas, SociÌ©tÌ© GÌ©nÌ©rale, CrÌ©dit Agricole ou encore BPCE sont soit bi-rÌ©seau, soit ne commercialisent que des Visa. Alors pourquoi les nÌ©obanques ne font-elles pas le mÌ»me choix ?A låÕexception dåÕOrange Bank, toutes les nÌ©obanques exerÌ_ant en France proposent des cartes bancaires de marque Mastercard. åÇ Ce constat est bien rÌ©el åÈ, nous a confirmÌ© Solveig HonorÌ© Hatton, directrice gÌ©nÌ©rale de Mastercard France. åÇ Compte Nickel, Morning, N26, Qonto, Ditto by Travelex, Treezor, Anytime, Revolut, Lydia ÌÊ une ou deux exceptions prÌ¬s, tous les acteurs qui se lancent dans le paiement font appel ÌÊ Mastercard åÈ. Selon la directrice de Mastercard France, ce choix est dÌÈ ÌÊ la proximitÌ© quåÕa su, trÌ¬s tÌ«t, tisser la sociÌ©tÌ© avec cet Ì©cosystÌ¬me. åÇ Nous avons Ì©tÌ© extrÌ»mement prÌ©curseurs dans le domaine des fintechs åÈ, souligne ainsi Solveig HonorÌ© Hatton. åÇ Au travers du programme Start Path, Mastercard collabore depuis 5 ans avec des start-ups du monde entier. Des partenariats qui donnent lieu notamment ÌÊ des prototypes dÌ©veloppÌ©s dans nos 7 labs åÈ. Parmi eux, celui de Dublin est principalement dÌ©diÌ© aux fintechs. Un quart des projets menÌ©s sont rÌ©alisÌ©s en collaboration avec ces start-ups.En France, le rÌ©seau de paiement est aussi actif. Il est par exemple partenaire depuis sa premiÌ¬re Ì©dition du Paris Fintech Forum, un forum mondial qui rÌ©unit les nouveaux acteurs de la finance. A låÕoccasion de cet Ì©vÌ©nement, åÇ nous organisons un dÌ©jeuner VIP avec låÕensemble de nos clients. 60 ÌÊ 80 fintechs y participent. LåÕoccasion pour elles de se faire connaÌ¨tre et de rencontrer nos partenaires bancaires åÈ, indique la directrice gÌ©nÌ©rale de Mastercard France.Mastercard accompagne le dÌ©veloppement des nÌ©obanquesLes start-ups mettent-elles vraiment en concurrence les deux rÌ©seaux de paiement ? Ou alors se tournent-elles naturellement vers Mastercard de part sa prÌ©sence dans l'Ì©cosystÌ¬me Fintech ? Non, rÌ©pond Eric Lassus, directeur gÌ©nÌ©ral de Treezor : åÇ Mastercard nåÕÌ©tait pas une Ì©vidence, nous nous sommes posÌ©s la question åÈ. CrÌ©Ì© en 2014, Treezor est un Ì©tablissement de paiement qui fournit aux nÌ©obanques des cartes et des services associÌ©s en marque blanche. Il sert donc dåÕintermÌ©diaire entre Mastercard et certaines jeunes pousses, dont Lydia et Qonto. En dåÕautres termes, cåÕest parce que Treezor est client de Mastercard que ces nÌ©obanques commercialisent des cartes Mastercard.Pour le CEO de Treezor, cåÕest låÕattitude åÇ trÌ¬s proactive åÈ et åÇ trÌ¬s ÌÊ låÕÌ©coute åÈ de la sociÌ©tÌ© amÌ©ricaine qui a fait pencher la balance en sa faveur. Et ce dans un contexte oÌ_ Visa ne såÕintÌ©ressait pas encore aux nouveaux acteurs du paiement. Mastercard propose d'accompagner directement les fintechs dans leur stratÌ©gie de dÌ©veloppement. Par exemple, via ses Ì©quipes rÌ©parties dans la plupart des pays, Mastercard peut les aider ÌÊ dÌ©ployer leur offre ÌÊ låÕÌ©tranger. Ce fut notamment le cas pour la nÌ©obanque britannique Revolut et låÕAllemande N26 qui se sont notamment appuyÌ©es sur Mastercard France pour såÕinstaller dans låÕHexagone selon Solveig HonorÌ© Hatton.Une offre complÌ©mentaire ÌÊ celle des fintechsMastercard semble aussi convaincre les start-ups grÌ¢ce ÌÊ ses investissements massifs en recherche et dÌ©veloppement. Autrefois, seulement Ì©metteur de cartes bancaires, la sociÌ©tÌ© se revendique dÌ©sormais comme une åÇ vraie sociÌ©tÌ© technologique dåÕinnovations dans les paiements åÈ, insiste Solveig HonorÌ© Hatton. Une Ì©volution qui ne laisse pas les start-ups indiffÌ©rentes. Selon Eric Lassus de Treezor, åÇ au moins 2 ans avant Visa, Mastercard a pris le tournant du numÌ©rique et a compris que le mÌ©tier du paiement Ì©tait en mutation åÈ.åÇ Au moins deux ans avant Visa, Mastercard a pris le tournant du numÌ©rique åÈRÌ©sultat, Mastercard est plus aguerri au fonctionnement open banking, aux API, et lance frÌ©quemment de nouveaux produits liÌ©s au paiement (portefeuille Ì©lectronique, service de cryptage ). La sociÌ©tÌ© propose par exemple aux nÌ©obanques sa propre offre de processing, ces serveurs qui autorisent une transaction en discutant avec le service monÌ©tique dåÕun commerÌ_ant et le systÌ¬me bancaire de la banque du client.Pour Eric Lassus, åÇ Mastercard rÌ»verait de proposer aux start-ups des packages de services en API åÈ. Un choix stratÌ©gique qui interroge car, en dÌ©veloppant ainsi son offre, Mastercard risque de devenir concurrent de certaines fintechs clientes. InterrogÌ© sur ce point, Mastercard prÌ©fÌ¬re souligner la complÌ©mentaritÌ© des offres. Selon Solveig HonorÌ© Hatton, åÇ les fintechs sont trÌ¬s fortes dans låÕexpÌ©rience client, dans le fait de dÌ©nicher un besoin que le marchÌ© ne satisfait pas encore. Les technologies et låÕexpertise que nous apportons sont, elles, des facilitateurs qui vont permettre aux fintechs de rÌ©aliser leurs projets åÈ. Par exemple, åÇ notre plateforme de tokenisation permet ÌÊ nåÕimporte quelle entreprise financiÌ¬re de proposer le paiement mobile en toute sÌ©curitÌ©. Treezor, qui låÕa implÌ©mentÌ©e, peut du coup proposer ÌÊ låÕensemble des fintechs, avec qui elle travaille, le paiement mobile åÈ, argumente la directrice gÌ©nÌ©rale du rÌ©seau en France.Lire aussi : Le paiement, nouveau champ de bataille entre banques, fintechs et marchandsVisa adopte une stratÌ©gie diffÌ©renteDans ces conditions, Visa peut-il revenir dans la course ? Et le souhaite-t-il vraiment ? ContactÌ©, Visa nåÕa pas pu donner suite ÌÊ nos sollicitations. Mais le match nåÕest pas terminÌ©. Visa vient en effet de contractualiser avec deux nouveaux acteurs de la banque. Pas des moindres : Orange Bank et la licorne britannique Revolut.LancÌ©e en novembre 2017, la banque mobile dåÕOrange envoie ainsi ÌÊ ses clients des cartes Visa. Un partenariat qui dÌ©coule du rachat par Orange de Groupama Banque, qui commercialisait dÌ©jÌÊ des cartes Visa. Du cÌ«tÌ© de Revolut, le choix paraÌ¨t dÌ©libÌ©rÌ©. La nÌ©obanque, qui passait autrefois par un intermÌ©diaire, a rÌ©cemment pris son indÌ©pendance monÌ©tique et fournit dÌ©sormais ÌÊ ses clients une Visa ou une Mastercard. InterrogÌ© sur ce basculement, le porte-parole en France de Revolut nous a expliquÌ© quåÕil såÕest fait dans låÕintÌ©rÌ»t de ses clients qui pourront ÌÊ terme choisir låÕÌ©metteur de cartes quåÕils prÌ©fÌ¬rent. åÇ Pour le moment, nous ne donnons pas encore le choix aux utilisateurs mais cela devrait venir dans le futur åÈ, prÌ©cise en effet Emmanuel Boulade, responsable communication en France de la nÌ©obanque britannique.åÇ Visa a loupÌ© le coche et essaie dÌ©sormais de se rattraper åÈTreezor Ì©galement ne såÕinterdit pas de contractualiser avec Visa. åÇ Notre systÌ¬me est agnostique et au service de nos clients. Nous pouvons travailler avec Visa. Si nos clients nous imposaient un schÌ©ma Visa, nous pourrions le faire åÈ, explique Eric Lassus. Ce dernier souligne par ailleurs que åÇ Visa a bien conscience quåÕil avait loupÌ© le coche et essaie dÌ©sormais de se rattraper. La sociÌ©tÌ© met vraiment le paquet... åÈ Autre hypothÌ¬se, son attentisme serait dÌ©libÌ©rÌ©. Et, plutÌ«t que de contractualiser avec toutes les fintechs, Visa viserait celles amenÌ©es ÌÊ se dÌ©velopper rapidement ou celles qui atteignent une taille importante ÌÊ låÕimage de Revolut dont la valorisation est estimÌ©e ÌÊ quelque 1,7 milliard de dollars.","Selon la directrice de Mastercard France, ce choix est dÌÈ ÌÊ la proximitÌ© quåÕa su, trÌ¬s tÌ«t, tisser la sociÌ©tÌ© avec cet Ì©cosystÌ¬me.Des partenariats qui donnent lieu notamment ÌÊ des prototypes dÌ©veloppÌ©s dans nos 7 labs åÈ.CrÌ©Ì© en 2014, Treezor est un Ì©tablissement de paiement qui fournit aux nÌ©obanques des cartes et des services associÌ©s en marque blanche.Il sert donc dåÕintermÌ©diaire entre Mastercard et certaines jeunes pousses, dont Lydia et Qonto.Treezor, qui låÕa implÌ©mentÌ©e, peut du coup proposer ÌÊ låÕensemble des fintechs, avec qui elle travaille, le paiement mobile åÈ, argumente la directrice gÌ©nÌ©rale du rÌ©seau en France.","['visa', 'ÌÊ', 'des', 'le', 'les', 'fintechs', 'en', 'bataille', 'la', 'vs', 'mastercard', 'et', 'remportera', 'qui']",,,[],2018-05-11 14:39:49+02:00,https://www.cbanque.com/actu/68048/mastercard-vs-visa-qui-remportera-la-bataille-des-fintechs,,,,
Mastercard Seeks 'Fast Track' Way to Sync Blockchain Data,"Payments giant Mastercard wants to patent a way to quickly add new nodes to a blockchain network, new filings reveal.In a patent application published Thursday by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, the company outlines a method by which nodes can connect with and verify the contents of a particular blockchain. Per Mastercard, the idea is to boost the speed at which the nodes ‰ÛÒ which store a copy of that network's transaction history ‰ÛÒ can get up to date.Mastercard first filed the application back in October 2016. And as the application explains, ""a blockchain may store thousands, millions, or even billions of transaction records over time in a vast number of different blocks.""While this is part of its immutable nature, this also means the blockchain could ""contain thousands, millions, or billions of blocks, each of which must be verified by the new node prior to the generation and addition of new blocks to the blockchain.""The payments firm goes on to say:""The verification of such a large number of blocks may take a significant amount of time, during which new blocks may be added to the blockchain, further delaying the ability for the new node to participate ... Thus, there is a need for a technical solution to increase the speed at which a blockchain may be navigated for verification thereof, which can thereby reduce the time required for a new node to begin participating in the blockchain.""In order to do this, the proposed system would include so-called ""fast track flags"" included in block headers. Nodes, per Mastercard, would be able to use those flags to scan over the blockchain's contents more quickly.Notably, the filing also discusses using a specially configured blockchain, which would act as the software counterpart to the nodes and help enable further efficiencies.Image Credit: Africa Studio / Shutterstock.comThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Will Mastercard Do a Stock Split in 2018?,"Mastercard (NYSE:MA) has been a key player in the revolution in payment methods that has taken root over the past half-century. Yet what surprises many financial sector investors is that Mastercard has only been available as a publicly traded stock for just over a decade. Already in that time, the card giant has done what many companies haven't: delivered a stock split to its shareholders.Many investors, however, are never satisfied, and some can never get too much of what they see as a good thing. With several years having passed since Mastercard's last move and the stock performing well, those impatient investors would like to see another stock split in the near future. How likely is such a decision in 2018? Below, we'll take a closer look.Mastercard's past stock splitsMastercard has done just one stock split in its short history as a publicly traded company. The chart below gives some information about it.Date of Split Split Ratio 100 shares in 2008 would now be: Jan. 21, 2014 10-for-1 1,000 sharesWhen you look back at what prompted Mastercard to make its decision to split its stock, the events show the sea change in attitudes about stock splits that has taken place over the past 20 years. In the past, the stock's initial run beyond the $100 mark might well have spurred discussion about whether a split would be appropriate. That happened within a year of its initial public offering, and yet Mastercard showed no interest in doing a split.Even during the financial crisis, the stock kept its foothold in triple-digit share prices, and after the crisis had passed, the price just kept climbing. Only toward the end of 2013, when the stock had jumped to about $750 per share, did the card network giant finally give in and make the announcement.CEO Ajay Banga was succinct at the time in his comments about the split. ""Today's actions reflect our ongoing commitment to deliver shareholder value,"" he said, ""as well as our confidence in the long-term growth and financial performance of our company.""How Mastercard has done since its splitCompanies often see their stocks take a breather after doing a split, and as you can see from the chart above, that was partially the case for Mastercard. But in the past two years, the card giant has continued its rocket ride higher, crossing convincingly into triple digits and showing few signs of slowing.The fact remains, though, that investors' attitudes toward stock splits have changed dramatically, and a return to the old ways of making moves isn't likely. At the very least, past precedent suggests that Mastercard will need to quadruple in price before it starts to approach the level at which company executives would consider a split. A greater number of four-digit stock prices elsewhere in the market might even prompt Mastercard not to make such a move even if it were to enjoy a big run higher.Don't expect a Mastercard stock split in 2018Mastercard has plenty of promise, and investors see potential for another strong year for the company in 2018. But for those who for whatever reason want to see their confidence in the stock confirmed by an executive decision for the company to split its shares, the coming year is likely only to bring disappointment.","Already in that time, the card giant has done what many companies haven't: delivered a stock split to its shareholders.With several years having passed since Mastercard's last move and the stock performing well, those impatient investors would like to see another stock split in the near future.Mastercard's past stock splitsMastercard has done just one stock split in its short history as a publicly traded company.Date of Split Split Ratio 100 shares in 2008 would now be: Jan. 21, 2014 10-for-1 1,000 sharesWhen you look back at what prompted Mastercard to make its decision to split its stock, the events show the sea change in attitudes about stock splits that has taken place over the past 20 years.Don't expect a Mastercard stock split in 2018Mastercard has plenty of promise, and investors see potential for another strong year for the company in 2018.","['stock', 'investors', '2018', 'mastercard', 'financial', 'company', 'past', 'decision', 'giant', 'likely', 'split']",,,"['Dan Caplinger', ""Dan Caplinger Has Been A Contract Writer For The Motley Fool Since As The Fool'S Director Of Investment Planning"", 'Dan Oversees Much Of The Personal-Finance', 'Investment-Planning Content Published Daily On Fool.Com.

Mastercard Keeps Delivering Record Results,"For a long time, many have seen Mastercard (NYSE:MA) merely as the also-ran to Visa, its chief competitor in the credit card space. Yet Mastercard has been working hard to get the better of its larger rival, following a slightly different strategic vision that's focused on international markets that are only now getting around to developing electronic payment systems and infrastructure. Key acquisitions have also added capabilities to its business, and many have hoped that these moves would help to narrow the gap between the two.Coming into Thursday's second-quarter financial report, Mastercard shareholders expected to see continued gains in revenue and net income, reflecting solid conditions for the global economy. Its results outpaced those expectations considerably, with record numbers that emphasize the smart execution that the payment network specialist has achieved. Let's look more closely at what the latest results say about the company and its prospects.Mastercard keeps picking up speedMastercard's second-quarter results continued its streak of impressive performance. Revenue was up 13% to $3.05 billion, which was even better than analysts' consensus forecast for roughly 10% top-line growth. Net income climbed 11% to $1.18 billion, and that produced earnings of $1.10 per share, which was $0.06 per share higher than what most of those following the stock had been looking to see.The company's efforts to improve efficiency showed up clearly and positively in the results. Operating expenses grew at just a 7% pace, helping to boost operating income by a fifth, and resulting in a nearly three percentage point rise in operating margin. Tax rates also fell slightly, helping drive earnings still higher, and stock buybacks continued to reduce the number of shares outstanding, providing further bottom-line support.Fundamentally, things are going right for Mastercard. The company saw gross dollar volume rise 9% on an adjusted basis worldwide, with a 17% jump in switched transactions to more than 16 billion. Cards outstanding rose 6% to 2.38 billion, and cross-border transaction volume climbed 14% when measured in local currency terms.Mastercard's global strategy continued to pay off, with international results outpacing those from the sluggish U.S. market. Gross dollar volume was up just 3% in the U.S., compared with 11% gains on an adjusted basis internationally. With over two-thirds of its volume coming from outside the U.S., Mastercard has truly aligned its fate with the health of the global economy, although concerns about whether the company is making the most of its domestic opportunities remain.Can Mastercard climb higher?CEO Ajay Banga explained the results from a strategic standpoint. ""This growth is driven by our focus on providing products and solutions that help our issuers, merchants, and partners gain real value beyond the transaction,"" Banga said. ""Our investments in Fast ACH, B2B payments, and advanced security technologies increasingly position us as the one-stop shop for our partners' electronic payment needs.""Already, the investments that Banga mentioned are paying off. Acquisitions contributed two percentage points to the company's net revenue growth, with most of the impact coming from its purchase of U.K. payment technology unit Vocalink. Those acquisitions have also added to operating expenses, but long term, they could reward the Mastercard with faster growth and new opportunities for collaborative partnerships with key players in the industry.Mastercard also bought back another 8 million shares during the quarter, spending $931 million, and added another 1.8 million shares during the first part of July.

"IoT Creates Value for Mastercard, UPS, Boeing and Kroger","The IoT hype is real. Use cases across the world show a clear, tangible ROI for cities and companies who successfully deploy the Internet of Things (IoT) and data analytics. Whether through driving efficiencies, eliminating redundancies or by opening the door for entirely new services, the IoT is a proven tool that organizations can use to carry out their goals and visions.Attendees at IoT World 2018 saw just how true this message is. Held from May 14 to 17 at the Santa Clara Convention Center in California, attendees came together to witness breakthroughs in the Internet of Things industry, listen to best practices and address growing concerns. Along the way, a wide range of companies representing equally myriad industries were able to show audiences just how IoT was changing their business model and landscape. These presentations also illustrated how these solutions have entered the mainstream - each of the companies listed here are on the Fortune 500.Here are four of the most transformative cases of major companies utilizing the IoT to achieve their strategic visions.MastercardThrough real-time data analytics, the IoT is enabling this financial services giant to transform customer experiences. Senior VP of Commerce for Every Device Kiki Del Valle delivered a keynote on how Mastercard is utilizing these new innovations to replace physical wallets, create ‰ÛÏvirtual dressing rooms‰Ûù during transactions and integrate VR into the buying experience. All of this is designed to give end users greater control of their shopping experiences. ‰ÛÏCustomers want to be part of the creation experience,‰Ûù Del Valle said.KrogerThis grocery store franchise was an early adopter of the Internet of Things. Placing an early bet on Zigbee has opened the door to a number of applications Kroger uses to improve quality and efficiency, including temperature monitoring, security camera access points, the RAD employee management, prescriptive production planning. ‰ÛÏDevices become systems, systems become services,‰Ûù Kroger VP of R&D Brett Bonner said. The company continues to leverage the IoT, with dynamic digital shelf edge technology expected to reduce the number of new product failures, enable real-time marketing and reduce waste.BoeingA recurring theme of this year‰Ûªs event was security, which Boeing VP of IT Product Systems Russ Berman established early on. With a keynote that stressed how safety was the core concern of Boeing‰Ûªs IoT strategy, Berman explained how the aerospace company‰Ûªs use of digital threading and digital twinning brought both security and efficiency to their operations.UPSWhen the volcanic eruptions at EyjafjallajÌ_kull in 2010 constrained airspace across Europe, it took UPS only one day to get back to business as usual. Such is the power of digital innovation, as Chief Information and Engineering Officer Juan Perez explained in his keynote. Perez described UPS as ‰ÛÏa technology company that delivers packages,‰Ûù detailing how IoT deployments such as smart trucks, smart handhelds and smart labeling have contributed to the data driving their prescriptive analytics strategies.","Use cases across the world show a clear, tangible ROI for cities and companies who successfully deploy the Internet of Things (IoT) and data analytics.Here are four of the most transformative cases of major companies utilizing the IoT to achieve their strategic visions.‰ÛÏDevices become systems, systems become services,‰Ûù Kroger VP of R&D Brett Bonner said.BoeingA recurring theme of this year‰Ûªs event was security, which Boeing VP of IT Product Systems Russ Berman established early on.Perez described UPS as ‰ÛÏa technology company that delivers packages,‰Ûù detailing how IoT deployments such as smart trucks, smart handhelds and smart labeling have contributed to the data driving their prescriptive analytics strategies.","['things', 'companies', 'digital', 'systems', 'services', 'creates', 'iot', 'keynote', 'smart', 'ups', 'kroger', 'boeing', 'vp', 'mastercard', 'value', 'security']",,,[],,https://www.smartresilient.com/internet-of-things-companies,,,,
Mastercard Says Fewer Crypto Purchases Led To Drop in First Quarter Growth,"Mastercard‰Ûªs quarterly growth was marked by a slight drop due to a decrease in the number of customers purchasing cryptocurrencies with the company‰Ûªs credit cards, CNBC reported May 3.Consumers can use Mastercard to acquire digital currencies, a practice forbidden by some financial institutions. Earlier this year, Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, and Citigroup prohibited such purchases, referring to potential credit risks and cryptocurrency volatility.Mastercard‰Ûªs cross-border volumes reportedly grew by 19 percent, though that figure dropped by 2 percentage points from the fourth quarter, partly due to fewer purchases of cryptocurrencies by their cardholders.Mastercard chief financial officer Martina Hund-Mejean said one reason was ‰ÛÏthe recent drop-off in crypto wallet funding,"" although according to her, the company is expecting international growth to moderate. Mastercard CEO Ajay Banga highlighted uncertainty in Asia, saying some exchanges are pulling back in South Korea, while others in Japan have security concerns:""There's a lot of concerns even in Japan because one of their biggest exchanges got hacked. As you can see, right now there's a little less interest than there was in the latter part of the fourth quarter and the first quarter.""He further stated that digital currency is not a major part of their corporate strategy because it‰Ûªs hard to predict how the sector will develop:""This is not something we count on because we just don't know how to predict it or we don't even want to count it.""Despite the slight dip in growth, Mastercard stock went up more than three percent on Wednesday after their reported first quarter profits beat Wall Street expectations. At press time their shares were trading at $186.48.In October last year, Banga was vocally opposed to digital currency that was not backed by a government. ‰ÛÏIf the government creates digital currency, we will find a way to be in the game. We will provide rails for moving currency from customer to merchant. The government mandated digital currencies are interesting. Non-government mandated currency is junk,‰Ûù he said.","Despite the slight dip in growth, Mastercard stock went up more than three percent on Wednesday after their reported first quarter profits beat Wall Street expectations.In October last year, Banga was vocally opposed to digital currency that was not backed by a government.‰ÛÏIf the government creates digital currency, we will find a way to be in the game.The government mandated digital currencies are interesting.Non-government mandated currency is junk,‰Ûù he said.","['fewer', 'slight', 'led', 'predict', 'digital', 'purchases', 'currency', 'quarter', 'mandated', 'growth', 'drop', 'reported', 'mastercard', 'crypto']",,,[],2018-05-04 05:12:00+01:00,https://cointelegraph.com/news/mastercard-says-fewer-crypto-purchases-led-to-drop-in-first-quarter-growth,,,,

Comparing Two Credit Giants - How Mastercard Inc. Stacks Up Against Visa Inc. Post-Earnings,"In the world of investing, perhaps no two companies appear to be as fundamentally similar as American credit card giants Mastercard Inc (NYSE:MA) and Visa Inc (NYSE: V ). Both companies have very similar five-year stock price appreciation growth rates (230% and 220%, respectively). They have similar dividend yields (0.6% and 0.7%, respectively) and valuation TTM P/E multiples (35 and 41, respectively). And they have similar market capitalizations ($160 billion and $253 billion, respectively).Comparing these two companies helps identify strengths and weaknesses in both. In the wake of earnings results, which beat expectations for both companies, this is especially useful for investors deciding which company to take a position in. I‰Ûªll take a long-term view with both firms, looking at the fundamental growth drivers for each and highlighting key aspects of each company‰Ûªs business model for investors interested in the consumer spending sector.Mastercard‰Ûªs Costs Outpacing RevenueMastercard, which just reported earnings this week, continues to impress investors. It‰Ûªs posting very strong double-digit top- and bottom-line numbers. These numbers are supported by much higher growth rates in most of the company‰Ûªs international markets compared to relatively slow domestic growth. Mastercard‰Ûªs appeal to many investors has been the company‰Ûªs diverse portfolio of markets. This spreads out much of the company‰Ûªs idiosyncratic risk across a number of emerging markets. And these markets carry far greater long-term growth potential than mature markets in North America.That said, I have a hesitation with Mastercard. It has impressive growth rates and the ability to return substantial value to shareholders each and every quarter. But Mastercard‰Ûªs operating costs have been increasing at a faster rate than revenues. This leads to a slight decline in operating margin. That‰Ûªs one of the key fundamental factors I look to with credit card companies. Operating margin is one of the easiest and cleanest metrics to assess for a company in the consumer credit space. Strength within consumer spending and the broader global economy has a very high correlation to the operating margin of companies such as Mastercard and Visa. Just take a look at the company‰Ûªs operating margin over the past 10 years.Visa and Mastercard‰Ûªs Low Dividend YieldsBoth Mastercard and Visa likely have experienced lower investor demand for their shares because they have very low dividend yields. This is more than offset, however, for investors considering total distribution to shareholders. One of the key drivers behind Mastercard‰Ûªs impressive share price appreciation over the past five years (more than tripling) is the company‰Ûªs massive share buy-back program. The program has continued to result in continued reductions in terms of shares outstanding in recent years.Since the beginning of the year, Mastercard has returned more than $2.5 billion to shareholders in the form of share buy-backs. That compares to $700 million in dividend payments. Combining the two amounts, we can see that an investor‰Ûªs total yield from distributions increases to 2% ($3.2 billion divided by the company‰Ûªs market capitalization of $159 billion) from a measly 0.6% dividend yield. That‰Ûªs a much more attractive yield for long-term, income-focused investors.Visa Beats Mastercard on Several FrontsVisa is the larger brother of Mastercard. It has a bigger chunk of overall global market share. And it has a strong pipeline of innovative products and services ready to take it to the next level. Therefore, it‰Ûªs understandable why Visa has maintained a positive valuation multiple variance compared to Mastercard.Visa‰Ûªs gross margin as a percentage of revenue is forecasted to continue to fall in the high-60% range. Its forward P/E of 23 reflects a significant amount of earnings growth compared to its TTM P/E of 41. Two innovative services, ‰ÛÏmVisa‰Ûù and ‰ÛÏVisa Direct,‰Ûù stand to continue to provide above-average healthy growth for decades to come. Visa‰Ûªs integrated relationships with customers and suppliers, along with an incentive program considered one of the best in the industry, makes Visa appear fairly valued at its current state.Chris MacDonald has no position in any stocks mentioned in this article.","In the world of investing, perhaps no two companies appear to be as fundamentally similar as American credit card giants Mastercard Inc (NYSE:MA) and Visa Inc (NYSE: V ).Operating margin is one of the easiest and cleanest metrics to assess for a company in the consumer credit space.Strength within consumer spending and the broader global economy has a very high correlation to the operating margin of companies such as Mastercard and Visa.Just take a look at the company‰Ûªs operating margin over the past 10 years.Visa and Mastercard‰Ûªs Low Dividend YieldsBoth Mastercard and Visa likely have experienced lower investor demand for their shares because they have very low dividend yields.","['margin', 'visa', 'giants', 'investors', 'dividend', 'companys', 'companies', 'stacks', 'comparing', 'markets', 'growth', 'postearnings', 'credit', 'operating', 'mastercard']",,,['Chris Macdonald'],2017-11-10 07:05:46-04:00,https://investorplace.com/2017/11/how-mastercard-inc-stacks-up-against-visa-inc-post-earnings/,,,,
MasterCard strengthens ties to mobile network operators,"MasterCard is working with M-Kopa, whose customers can purchase a solar home system on credit and then make small daily payments using mobile money stored in their accounts for the amount of electricity they need for the day.MasterCard is strengthening its ties with mobile network operators with a new suite of services that are intended to help those companies better assist subscribers and small businesses connect to digital payment experiences.The Purchase, New York-based card network has already helped MNOs such as Vodafone Ukraine, Digicel Group in the Caribbean, Viettel Telecom in Vietnam and Taiwan's Chunghwa Telecom to roll out various services related to these new offerings such as Masterpass integration, direct carrier billing and QR code-based payments as well as data insights for small business to help them identify new opportunities.Mobile operators over the years have traditionally dealt with direct carrier billing companies for similar services, but such efforts mostly address digital content. MasterCard believes it is in a better position to help MNOs to bridge the gap between digital and physical goods for both subscribers and small businesses.That is an issue direct carrier billers have worked on for the past few years, but with varying degrees of success.""We've been working with MNOs for years,"" Kiki Del Valle, senior vice president of commerce for every device at MasterCard, told Mobile Payments Today in an interview ahead of the official announcement. ""The difference with what we have now is that MNOs are going through this transformation and it's allowing for new opportunities to rely on more traditional forms of payments and moving beyond just having a prepaid companion card associated with a mobile money account.""If you think about it, that was the traditional extent of the relationship. What we're finding now is a lot more willingness and openness [from the MNOs] to work with MasterCard to be creative around solutions and to identify ways we can innovate.""One unique way MasterCard is helping MNOs innovate is a program in East Africa that enables mobile subscribers to pay for electricity via solar panels using the card network's QR code technology.MasterCard is working with M-Kopa, a company that provides clean energy to some 3 million citizens in East Africa.M-Kopa's customers can purchase a solar home system on credit and then make small daily payments using mobile money stored in their accounts for the amount of electricity they need for the day. Those customers complete the payment either scanning a QR code from their smartphone or entering the merchant ID associated with the QR code into their feature phone.In turn, those solar energy users can then charge their neighbors access to electricity they might need and settle payment through mobile money accounts.""It brings it back to the power of the IoT and connected things and also the role the MNOs are playing,"" Del Valle said about the solar energy initiative. ""Ultimately, it's the MNOs that are holding the mobile money so that the consumer is topping up and now using it not only for data services, but to also pay for energy.""Such an initiative also plays into the drive to include more people into financial services.Companies and governments in African and Latin American nations as well as in countries such as India have long sought to help more citizens find their way into a digital payment ecosystem that continues to grow year by year.""The other aspect [to the solar energy partnership] is to actually help drive additional use cases for that specific [financially] underserved person that we're trying so hard to get into the digital space with such services,"" Del Valle said.One of the more eye-popping examples of this is MasterCard's partnership with Military Bank in Vietnam that enables Viettel Telecom to offer its more than 3 million customers access to physical and prepaid cards. Some 700,000 of those customers have requested the companion card to do things such as P2P transfers and to pay for utility bills and airline tickets.","MasterCard is strengthening its ties with mobile network operators with a new suite of services that are intended to help those companies better assist subscribers and small businesses connect to digital payment experiences.Mobile operators over the years have traditionally dealt with direct carrier billing companies for similar services, but such efforts mostly address digital content.MasterCard believes it is in a better position to help MNOs to bridge the gap between digital and physical goods for both subscribers and small businesses.""We've been working with MNOs for years,"" Kiki Del Valle, senior vice president of commerce for every device at MasterCard, told Mobile Payments Today in an interview ahead of the official announcement.In turn, those solar energy users can then charge their neighbors access to electricity they might need and settle payment through mobile money accounts.","['ties', 'strengthens', 'small', 'help', 'digital', 'services', 'solar', 'payments', 'mobile', 'operators', 'network', 'mnos', 'money', 'mastercard']",,,['Will Hernandez'],2018-02-28 00:12:24-05:00,https://www.mobilepaymentstoday.com/articles/mastercard-strengthens-ties-to-mobile-network-operators/,,,,
Mastercard drive for economic development in Africa [Business Africa],"The ultimate resource in economic development is people. This is because it is people that have the ability to develop any economy.Mastercard recently acquired a mobile payments technology company, Oltio from Standard Bank that will further enable the company to complement its digital payment strategy to displace cash in emerging markets across the Middle East and Africa (MEA) region.This is in recognition of the fact that customers in Middle East and Africa need a secure way to make payment and this will reinforce the digital payment strategy that the company has set about achieving.Africa most especially, will benefit more from the acquisition of Oltio, which is a start-up that pioneered several payment solutions. In 2014 for example, Oltio was appointed as a service provider to Mastercard to develop and launch the Masterpass digital wallet in South Africa. Masterpass is an interoperable platform by Mastercard that allows bank customers in South Africa use their PINs and mobile phones to authenticate purchases, removing the need for a physical card while providing simplicity, security and convenience to consumers. The platform has seen impressive growth in the region and it is no doubt that such successes can be replicated all over Africa.With such payment solutions available in Africa, economic development can become something achievable because it cuts away unnecessary parts of the banking and purchase system as seen in developed continents of the world. .According to Mastercard‰Ûªs Vice-President of Business Integration, Gabriel Swanepoel, mobile payments are gaining equity among consumers who want to pay for goods and services using their mobile phone wherever they shop, be it online, in an app or at a physical retailer.They have leveraged on this need using Oltio‰Ûªs technology, people and infrastructure to enhance and scale digital products.Businesses in Africa can now leverage on this new method and attract more cutomers for their products and services even beyond Africa.It thereby allows Mastercard to continue supporting banks in expanding the growth and adoption of digital payments, while ensuring real consumer pain points are addressed, and increasing economic develop in Africa.With the success in South Africa, other parts of Africa are sure to follow and this will inspire greater development of the economy because of the new levels of employment that will be generated from the initiative, which will invariably feed the economy.Already, members of the working population and more, all across Africa, can expect to benefit from such innovations because it brings Africa to the limelight and view of such companies.Africa can then benefit immensely from the initiatives that such organisations will bring to bear.In a recent news report, it is reported that up to 30 million youth from across Africa are set to benefit from a new Mastercard Foundation initiative, Young Africa Works Strategy, which was recently officially unveiled in Kigali, Rwanda.","Africa most especially, will benefit more from the acquisition of Oltio, which is a start-up that pioneered several payment solutions.In 2014 for example, Oltio was appointed as a service provider to Mastercard to develop and launch the Masterpass digital wallet in South Africa.Businesses in Africa can now leverage on this new method and attract more cutomers for their products and services even beyond Africa.It thereby allows Mastercard to continue supporting banks in expanding the growth and adoption of digital payments, while ensuring real consumer pain points are addressed, and increasing economic develop in Africa.With the success in South Africa, other parts of Africa are sure to follow and this will inspire greater development of the economy because of the new levels of employment that will be generated from the initiative, which will invariably feed the economy.","['business', 'mastercard', 'digital', 'strategy', 'payments', 'south', 'africa', 'mobile', 'oltio', 'economic', 'benefit', 'development', 'drive', 'payment']",,,[],4/26/18 0:00,http://www.africanews.com/2018/04/26/mastercard-drive-for-economic-development-in-africa-business-africa/,,,,

The platform has seen impressive growth in the region and it is no doubt that such successes can be replicated all over Africa.With such payment solutions available in Africa, economic development can become something achievable because it cuts away unnecessary parts of the banking and purchase system as seen in developed continents of the world. .According to Mastercard‰Ûªs Vice-President of Business Integration, Gabriel Swanepoel, mobile payments are gaining equity among consumers who want to pay for goods and services using their mobile phone wherever they shop, be it online, in an app or at a physical retailer.They have leveraged on this need using Oltio‰Ûªs technology, people and infrastructure to enhance and scale digital products.Businesses in Africa can now leverage on this new method and attract more cutomers for their products and services even beyond Africa.It thereby allows Mastercard to continue supporting banks in expanding the growth and adoption of digital payments, while ensuring real consumer pain points are addressed, and increasing economic develop in Africa.With the success in South Africa, other parts of Africa are sure to follow and this will inspire greater development of the economy because of the new levels of employment that will be generated from the initiative, which will invariably feed the economy.Already, members of the working population and more, all across Africa, can expect to benefit from such innovations because it brings Africa to the limelight and view of such companies.Africa can then benefit immensely from the initiatives that such organisations will bring to bear.In a recent news report, it is reported that up to 30 million youth from across Africa are set to benefit from a new Mastercard Foundation initiative, Young Africa Works Strategy, which was recently officially unveiled in Kigali, Rwanda.","Africa most especially, will benefit more from the acquisition of Oltio, which is a start-up that pioneered several payment solutions.In 2014 for example, Oltio was appointed as a service provider to Mastercard to develop and launch the Masterpass digital wallet in South Africa.Businesses in Africa can now leverage on this new method and attract more cutomers for their products and services even beyond Africa.It thereby allows Mastercard to continue supporting banks in expanding the growth and adoption of digital payments, while ensuring real consumer pain points are addressed, and increasing economic develop in Africa.With the success in South Africa, other parts of Africa are sure to follow and this will inspire greater development of the economy because of the new levels of employment that will be generated from the initiative, which will invariably feed the economy.","['mastercard', 'digital', 'strategy', 'payments', 'south', 'africa', 'mobile', 'oltio', 'economic', 'benefit', 'development', 'drive', 'payment']",,,['Google'],2018-04-27 17:30:12+02:00,http://www.newtimes.co.rw/africa/mastercard-drive-economic-development-africa,,,,

Drilling Down Into Mastercard Incorporated (MA),"Mastercard Incorporated (MA) is an interesting player in the Financial space, with a focus on Credit Services. The stock has been active on the tape, currently trading at $192.00, down from yesterday‰Ûªs close by -0.06%. Given the stock‰Ûªs recent action, it seemed like a good time to take a closer look at the company‰Ûªs recent data.Mastercard Incorporated (MA) currently trades with a market capitalization of $197.78 Billion. That value represents a market adjusting for revenues that have been growing by 30.94 % on a quarterly year/year basis as of the company‰Ûªs last quarterly report.You can get a sense of how sustainable that is by a levered free cash flow of $5.67 Billion over the past twelve months. Generally speaking, earnings are expected to grow in coming quarters. Analysts are forecasting earnings of $1.54 on a per share basis this quarter. Perhaps, that suggests something about why 0.12% of the outstanding share supply is held by institutional investors.It‰Ûªs important to check the technicals to get a sense of how MA has been acting. Looking at the stock‰Ûªs movement on the chart, Mastercard Incorporated recorded a 52-week high of $194.72. It is now trading 2.72% off that level. The stock is trading $179.31 its 50-day moving average by -12.69%. The stock carved out a 52-week low down at $115.55.In recent action, Mastercard Incorporated (MA) has made a move of +7.66% over the past month, which has come on Strong relative transaction volume. Over the trailing year, the stock is underperforming the S&P 500 by 15.83, and it‰Ûªs gotten there by action that has been more volatile on a day-to-day basis than most other stocks on the exchange. In terms of the mechanics underlying that movement, traders will want to note that the stock is trading on a float of 0.75% with $914.18 Million sitting short, betting on future declines. That suggests something of the likelihood of a short squeeze in shares of MA.","Mastercard Incorporated (MA) is an interesting player in the Financial space, with a focus on Credit Services.Given the stock‰Ûªs recent action, it seemed like a good time to take a closer look at the company‰Ûªs recent data.Mastercard Incorporated (MA) currently trades with a market capitalization of $197.78 Billion.Looking at the stock‰Ûªs movement on the chart, Mastercard Incorporated recorded a 52-week high of $194.72.In recent action, Mastercard Incorporated (MA) has made a move of +7.66% over the past month, which has come on Strong relative transaction volume.","['action', 'stock', 'suggests', 'drilling', 'trading', 'incorporated', 'basis', 'recent', 'ma', 'stocks', 'mastercard']",,,['Kelvin Wilson'],5/16/18 0:00,https://stocknewsjournal.com/2018/05/16/drilling-down-into-mastercard-incorporated-ma-5/,,,,
Critical Comparison: Western Digital Corporation (WDC) vs. Mastercard Incorporated (MA) ‰ÛÒ Stock News Gazette,"Western Digital Corporation (NASDAQ:WDC) shares are up more than 11.28% this year and recently increased 0.72% or $0.63 to settle at $88.50. Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), on the other hand, is up 27.50% year to date as of 05/23/2018. It currently trades at $192.99 and has returned 0.32% during the past week.Western Digital Corporation (NASDAQ:WDC) and Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) are the two most active stocks in the Data Storage Devices industry based on today‰Ûªs trading volumes. To determine if one is a better investment than the other, we will compare the two companies‰Ûª growth, profitability, risk, return, and valuation characteristics, as well as their analyst ratings and sentiment signals.The ability to grow earnings at a compound rate over time is a crucial determinant of investment value. Analysts expect WDC to grow earnings at a 21.67% annual rate over the next 5 years. Comparatively, MA is expected to grow at a 21.48% annual rate. All else equal, WDC‰Ûªs higher growth rate would imply a greater potential for capital appreciation.Growth in and of itself is not necessarily valuable, and it can even be harmful to shareholders if companies overinvest in unprofitable projects in pursuit of that growth. We will use EBITDA margin and Return on Investment (ROI), which adjust for differences in capital structure, as measure of profitability and return. , compared to an EBITDA margin of 24.04% for Mastercard Incorporated (MA). WDC‰Ûªs ROI is 6.40% while MA has a ROI of 44.00%. The interpretation is that MA‰Ûªs business generates a higher return on investment than WDC‰Ûªs.The value of a stock is simply the present value of its future free cash flows. WDC‰Ûªs free cash flow (‰ÛÏFCF‰Ûù) per share for the trailing twelve months was +2.12. Comparatively, MA‰Ûªs free cash flow per share was +0.79. On a percent-of-sales basis, WDC‰Ûªs free cash flow was 3.32% while MA converted 6.6% of its revenues into cash flow. This means that, for a given level of sales, MA is able to generate more free cash flow for investors.Liquidity and leverage ratios are important because they reveal the financial health of a company. WDC has a current ratio of 2.40 compared to 1.60 for MA. This means that WDC can more easily cover its most immediate liabilities over the next twelve months. WDC‰Ûªs debt-to-equity ratio is 0.99 versus a D/E of 1.13 for MA. MA is therefore the more solvent of the two companies, and has lower financial risk.WDC trades at a forward P/E of 6.54, a P/B of 2.33, and a P/S of 1.32, compared to a forward P/E of 26.11, a P/B of 35.54, and a P/S of 15.18 for MA. WDC is the cheaper of the two stocks on an earnings, book value and sales basis. Given that earnings are what matter most to investors, analysts tend to place a greater weight on the P/E.Analyst Price Targets and OpinionsWhen investing it‰Ûªs crucial to distinguish between price and value. As Warren Buffet said, ‰ÛÏprice is what you pay, value is what you get‰Ûù. WDC is currently priced at a -24.71% to its one-year price target of 117.54. Comparatively, MA is -1.58% relative to its price target of 196.09. This suggests that WDC is the better investment over the next year.Risk and VolatilityAnalyst use beta to measure a stock‰Ûªs volatility relative to the overall market. Stocks with a beta above 1 tend to have bigger swings in price than the market as a whole, the opposite being the case for stocks with a beta below 1. WDC has a beta of 1.04 and MA‰Ûªs beta is 1.18. WDC‰Ûªs shares are therefore the less volatile of the two stocks.The analysis of insider buying and selling trends can be extended to the aggregate level. Short interest, which represents the percentage of a stock‰Ûªs tradable shares currently being shorted, captures what the market as a whole feels about a stock. WDC has a short ratio of 1.49 compared to a short interest of 1.77 for MA. This implies that the market is currently less bearish on the outlook for WDC.Western Digital Corporation (NASDAQ:WDC) beats Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) on a total of 10 of the 14 factors compared between the two stocks. WDC is growing fastly, has higher cash flow per share, higher liquidity and has lower financial risk. In terms of valuation, WDC is the cheaper of the two stocks on an earnings, book value and sales basis, WDC is more undervalued relative to its price target. Finally, WDC has better sentiment signals based on short interest.","The ability to grow earnings at a compound rate over time is a crucial determinant of investment value.WDC‰Ûªs free cash flow (‰ÛÏFCF‰Ûù) per share for the trailing twelve months was +2.12.Comparatively, MA‰Ûªs free cash flow per share was +0.79.On a percent-of-sales basis, WDC‰Ûªs free cash flow was 3.32% while MA converted 6.6% of its revenues into cash flow.This means that, for a given level of sales, MA is able to generate more free cash flow for investors.","['cash', 'flow', 'stock', 'wdcs', 'wdc', 'digital', 'price', 'critical', 'incorporated', 'free', 'gazette', 'ma', 'investment', 'stocks', 'western', 'mastercard', 'value', 'vs']",,,[],5/24/18 0:00,http://stocknewsgazette.com/2018/05/24/critical-comparison-western-digital-corporation-wdc-vs-mastercard-incorporated-ma/,,,,

"Groupon debuts Groupon+, voucherless meal deals with Visa and Mastercard","Restaurant deals are some of the most popular offers on Groupon, the platform that lets you buy discounted experiences and goods from retailers near you. Today, the company is launching a new service to help promote that vertical more. Groupon+, as it is called, will let people use Groupon meal deals that they pay for with their Visa or MasterCard (credit or debit cards), and when they do so, they will get 30 percent of the value of the deal back to their accounts.Groupon+ will initially be available in 23 U.S. markets and 1,500 participating local restaurants and ‰ÛÏother neighborhood favorites.‰Ûù Later, Groupon plans to expand it to more categories like beauty, retail and home and auto services.Groupon+ is the latest move from Groupon in what has been a long series of ups and downs for the company, both in its food and wider business. The company ‰ÛÓ once a trailblazer in the world of ‰ÛÏdaily deals‰Ûù, time-based offers on services local to you ‰ÛÓ has been downsizing its operations, particularly internationally, as its business has moved on from its initial hype and to avoid going the way of many of its competitors: down and out of business.Groupon itself has managed to stay afloat amid that drama, and has even shaped up to be a consolidator of sorts, snapping up its once-arch rival, LivingSocial, for a song.In the food business, Groupon has long held ambitions to develop its relationship with restaurants into a bigger business, covering deliveries, point-of-sale services and more. Much of its wider ambitions beyond basic meal deals was positioned around Breadcrumb, a POS service it acquired in 2012 and used as the anchor for its strategy to expand its business not just in restaurants but elsewhere, too. It rebranded its wider point-of-sale business to Breadcrumb in 2013, and it went through several other iterations. Ultimately, though, it too was cut out in Groupon‰Ûªs downsizing: it was sold last year to Upserve (more about that sale here).Fast forward to today, and it looks like now Groupon has returned to making the basics of its service simply easier and stickier for consumers to use. Starting with the elimination of vouchers and the need to pay for services ahead of actually using them ‰ÛÓ two of the features of Groupon+ ‰ÛÓ seem to be very obvious friction points to remove.‰ÛÏBeing the daily habit in local means making the saving experience much more convenient for both customers and businesses,‰Ûù said Aaron Cooper, president of North America, Groupon, in a statement. ‰ÛÏWith Groupon+, diners sign up once, add cash-back offers to their credit or debit card, pay and save at their favorite restaurants without any additional hassles.‰ÛùThe idea behind working with Visa and MasterCard for these offers is also interesting. You could argue that Groupon was a very disruptive startup when it first opened for business in part because it was creating a new kind of platform and model for online-to-offline commerce: time-sensitive vouchers (offers were out for very limited time, thereby attracting small frenzies of FOMO buyers), that you bought in advance of ever using the good or service in question, on faith that you would actually use it, and the business would give it to you.All that is pretty revolutionary, but also demanding a lot of consumers: Groupon was essentially hoping that mass consumers could and would change their buying and spending habits.Ultimately, after the daily deals hype died down, it was clear that many simply did not.So this move is a nod in the direction of conventionality, in a way. Visa and MasterCard are already very ubiquitous when it comes to paying for a meal in a restaurant, with U.S. Visa holders spending $312 billion in the last year at fine-dining and quick-service restaurants, according to Doug Rappoport, VP, Visa Commerce Solutions, Visa.Now Groupon is hoping to tap into a bit of that to boost its own discounted meal offers. ‰ÛÏVisa‰Ûªs card-linked services enable Groupon+ participating businesses to turn manual offer redemption into an automated experience, which can help them drive incremental business and make for more loyal customers,‰Ûù Rappoport said in a statement.We‰Ûªre asking Groupon if the company plans to extend Groupon+ to other categories beyond food.Update: they are. ‰ÛÏWe definitely plan to move beyond restaurants,‰Ûù said a spokesperson. ‰ÛÏWe‰Ûªre really enthusiastic about the potential of these offers to translate well into other popular Groupon Local categories including beauty, retail and home and auto services.‰Ûù","Restaurant deals are some of the most popular offers on Groupon, the platform that lets you buy discounted experiences and goods from retailers near you.Groupon+, as it is called, will let people use Groupon meal deals that they pay for with their Visa or MasterCard (credit or debit cards), and when they do so, they will get 30 percent of the value of the deal back to their accounts.In the food business, Groupon has long held ambitions to develop its relationship with restaurants into a bigger business, covering deliveries, point-of-sale services and more.Now Groupon is hoping to tap into a bit of that to boost its own discounted meal offers.‰ÛÏWe‰Ûªre really enthusiastic about the potential of these offers to translate well into other popular Groupon Local categories including beauty, retail and home and auto services.‰Ûù","['deals', 'visa', 'business', 'offers', 'services', 'voucherless', 'restaurants', 'groupon', 'local', 'debuts', 'mastercard', 'meal', 'service']",,,['Ingrid Lunden'],9/7/17 0:00,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/07/groupon-debuts-groupon-voucherless-meal-deals-with-visa-and-mastercard/,,,,

Mastercard‰Ûªs New Platform Helps Kenyan Micromerchants Get Credit‰ÛÒAnd Restock Faster,"In Kawangware, an informal settlement in Nairobi, Edi Mbaiga oversees a small shop, no bigger than two square meters, which she took over from her father around seven years ago. She keeps it stocked with everything from fruits, vegetables, flour, and dried fish to soap and laundry detergent. Business was consistent, but Mbaiga wanted to expand the shop. To do that, she‰Ûªd need a loan, which, for a shop run entirely on an analog, cash-based system, was next to impossible to secure.A new digital platform for micromerchants‰ÛÒretailers that transact generally in very small sums and, because they mostly use cash, are excluded from form economies‰ÛÒin Nairobi is helping her to secure the extra funds to grow the shop. Called Kionect (a mashup between ‰ÛÏkiosk‰Ûù and ‰ÛÏconnect‰Ûù), and launched by Mastercard and a handful of on-the-ground partners in Kenya, the platform enables merchants to place and pay for an order from a partner wholesaler, Kaskazi, via text‰ÛÒeither an SMS from a feature phone or a message from a smartphone will work. Kaskazi acts as something of a wholesale aggregator from the region, sourcing products from various large retailers and delivering them on-demand to merchants. An East African financial institution, Diamond Trust Bank, facilitates mobile payments between the shop owners and Kaskazi, and all of the transactions are recorded and managed on the Kionect platform. The digital trail that builds up over a series of placed orders and payments equips the merchants with a credit history they can use to secure business loans from Musoni, a Kenyan microfinance provider.Kionect is one of the latest examples in a series of innovative approaches to establishing alternative measures of creditworthiness for people in the developing world, where cash still dominates. A Tanzania-based startup called First Access, for instance, uses mobile phone payment histories to build out credit scores. Around one month into its pilot program, Kionect has reached 1,100 small merchants in Nairobi. The initiative began, says Michael Elliot, vice president of Mastercard Labs for Financial Inclusion in Nairobi, with spending time with shop owners to get an understanding of their needs.‰ÛÏThese microretailers struggle to buy the supplies for their shops, and they struggle with the logistics of it,‰Ûù Elliot says. Restocking a store could mean having to close up shop for an hour and a half to trek to the wholesaler and bring the wares back, he adds. Mastercard selected Kaskazi as its wholesale partner for Kionect because it employs a network of delivery motorcyclists to bring the wares directly to shops. Each of the participating shops is geo-tagged on the platform and labeled with an identifying barcode, so delivery agents know where to bring the wares. ‰ÛÏThe whole point of Kionect is to understand the pain points of the merchants, and make it easier for them to do their jobs,‰Ûù Elliot says.For the time being, it‰Ûªs free for both merchants and wholesalers to use Kionect‰ÛÒthe Mastercard Lab for Financial Inclusion in Kenya, in 2014, received a $19 million grant from the Gates Foundation to develop and distribute products, like Kionect, designed to help merchants into the mainstream economy. Ultimately, the platform will roll out as a commercial product which merchants and wholesalers will pay a fee to use.Currently, the service is helping merchants not only to restock their stores more easily and establish a financial track record; it‰Ûªs also helping them budget and plan for new orders in advance. Kaka, another merchant who also runs a shop in Kawangware, would, in the past, take an inventory of his store to determine what he needed‰ÛÒsay, 10 packs of Nescafe and a kilo of rice. But he wouldn‰Ûªt find out how much it cost until he ventured to the wholesaler to pick it up because the prices tend to vary from wholesaler to wholesaler. On Kionect, he can price and pay for the orders in advance through its relationship with Kaskazi, which collects the order and totals the cost in advance of delivering it. For Kaka, the streamlined method helps him budget and plan for restocking more accurately.In the pilot phase, Kionect still presents some limitations for its users, chief among them being that the creditworthiness the merchants build up through the platform can only be used to apply for loans directly related to their businesses‰ÛÒeither physical expansion, or diversification of product offerings. It‰Ûªs Mastercard‰Ûªs hope, though, Elliot says, that the financial history the merchants accrue on Kionect could eventually translate into loans to help finance other areas of their lives, including homes and education. ‰ÛÏWe want to see this start to evolve into a relationship between merchants and banks that can grow beyond just the Kionect loan,‰Ûù Elliot says.","An East African financial institution, Diamond Trust Bank, facilitates mobile payments between the shop owners and Kaskazi, and all of the transactions are recorded and managed on the Kionect platform.Around one month into its pilot program, Kionect has reached 1,100 small merchants in Nairobi.Ultimately, the platform will roll out as a commercial product which merchants and wholesalers will pay a fee to use.But he wouldn‰Ûªt find out how much it cost until he ventured to the wholesaler to pick it up because the prices tend to vary from wholesaler to wholesaler.‰ÛÏWe want to see this start to evolve into a relationship between merchants and banks that can grow beyond just the Kionect loan,‰Ûù Elliot says.","['elliot', 'kaskazi', 'wholesaler', 'restock', 'helps', 'shop', 'nairobi', 'micromerchants', 'financial', 'mastercards', 'creditand', 'kionect', 'faster', 'kenyan', 'mastercard', 'platform', 'merchants']",,,"['About The Author', ""Eillie Anzilotti Is An Assistant Editor For Fast Company'S Ideas Section"", 'Covering Sustainability', 'Social Good', 'Alternative Economies.

"Elevate Credit, Mastercard Team Up On ‰ÛÏNew Middle Class‰Ûù Mobile Payments","Elevate Credit, Mastercard Team Up On ‰ÛÏNew Middle Class‰Ûù Mobile PaymentsApril 19, 2018 By: Steven AndersonCredit cards are possibly one of the first mobile payments systems. They‰Ûªve been around for years, and many mobile payments systems require them to work in the first place. However, they haven‰Ûªt always been available to everyone, and that‰Ûªs a point that Elevate and Mastercard are working to change, based on a report sent our way from Elevate.There are around 160 million Americans, the report notes, that have either low credit scores or none at all, and Elevate and Mastercard saw that as an opportunity to make some real progress in the market. Elevate refers to this massive bloc of Americans as the ‰ÛÏNew Middle Class,‰Ûù and so has brought out this new credit release.The product in question is a credit card with some impressive features; it not only boasts on / off functionality‰ÛÓwhich is great for those users concerned about identity theft; just shut off the card when it‰Ûªs not in use‰ÛÓas well as credit score monitoring, and a complete mobile app that offers fraud alerts and custom purchase alerts too. The card itself is set for a rollout later this year.So how can a credit card be given to people with no credit history, or a poor credit history? Are Elevate and Mastercard prepared to risk massive losses? As it turns out, the card will refer to a series of advanced analytics that go beyond the traditional credit score.With the labor market fundamentally changing thanks to increased automation, telecommuting and the ‰ÛÏgig economy‰Ûù, the old measures of credit scores‰ÛÓwhich actually depend on a demonstrated use of credit previously and actually fall the less you use it‰ÛÓare arguably completely wrong-headed. Using new measures could certainly help here, but it‰Ûªs enough to make me wonder who will bite. After all, a debit card serves much the same purpose as a credit card‰ÛÓyou can still reserve a hotel room or rent a car with one‰ÛÓbut without the potential disaster. Given how many people with no credit have no credit by choice, it‰Ûªs hard to see this team effort going far.Still, this might get some interest, and with 160 million Americans potentially reachable, getting even one in 10 would make for a nice slice of market share.","Elevate Credit, Mastercard Team Up On ‰ÛÏNew Middle Class‰Ûù Mobile PaymentsApril 19, 2018 By: Steven AndersonCredit cards are possibly one of the first mobile payments systems.They‰Ûªve been around for years, and many mobile payments systems require them to work in the first place.Elevate refers to this massive bloc of Americans as the ‰ÛÏNew Middle Class,‰Ûù and so has brought out this new credit release.So how can a credit card be given to people with no credit history, or a poor credit history?Given how many people with no credit have no credit by choice, it‰Ûªs hard to see this team effort going far.","['card', 'market', 'middle', 'report', 'elevate', 'systems', 'payments', 'class', 'mobile', 'americans', 'credit', 'team', 'mastercard']",,,[],4/19/18 0:00,https://paymentweek.com/2018-4-19-elevate-credit-mastercard-team-new-middle-class-mobile-payments/,,,,

How Mastercard Is Planning for a Post-Plastic World,"BARCELONA‰ÛÓFor many of us, swiping a credit card is the height of shopping efficiency. Sure, chip readers take a few extra seconds, but the process itself is still pretty easy, especially when compared to the array of contactless options‰ÛÓfrom Apple Pay to Samsung Pay to Google Pay, not to mention options from the credit card companies themselves.How can we make shopping simple, fast, and safe in a post-plastic world? That's Matt Miller's job.""We think about every device as a commerce device and we extend that beyond devices into technologies,"" says Miller, the VP of Commerce for Every Device at Mastercard.That means AR, VR, wearables, mobile phones, and even pieces of paper with QR codes printed on them. We spoke to Miller on the show floor here at Mobile World Congress, where the company announced a new way to finance the purchase of solar panels.Mastercard is working with Kenya-based solar provider M-KOPA to deliver easy financing of panels. Consumers pay an initial fee, and pay off their debt over a two-year period‰ÛÓall without traditional banks, wired internet, or even consistent electricity. According to Miller, ""IOT doesn't just have to affect the Tesla drivers and people that can afford batteries on their walls, it can also affect economies across the world.""Contactless payments are growing in the US, in part because of legacy credit card processing terminals littered throughout the country, but a lot of the world has already gone contactless. ""In a market like Australia, they use contactless everywhere,"" Miller says. ""They will look at you funny if you try to dip your card or swipe your card.""Contactless also comes with exponentially better security. With a plastic card, every transaction you make uses the same 16-digit number and every merchant‰ÛÓand more than a few waiters‰ÛÓget a copy. ""With mobile tokenization we're creating different 16-digital numbers and adding additional cryptography protection that allow those transactions to be really secure,"" Miller says.For what it's worth, Miller also provided some anecdotal evidence about the growing appeal of contactless payments. ""My wife only uses her contactless,"" Miller says. ""She rarely has her credit card on her because her ecosystem of merchants covers that from end to end.""Much of Miller's time is focused on creating payment systems for voice-driven interfaces, and the platforms are uniquely challenging. There are no screens and every command has to be limited to a few phrases. ""One of the places you see success with voice assistants, as opposed to chatbots, is that they have been able to go deeper into AI in order to be recommendation driven,"" Miller says.What happens when that AI only pushes Amazon products, or steers you towards Google's products and services instead of Apple's? Those are just some of challenges we'll have to adapt to in the post-plastic age. ""Ultimately, it is going to come down to AI that we can trust, that knows us, and brings us the things that are truly best for us,"" Miller says.Watch our entire interview above and back episodes of Fast Forward here.","BARCELONA‰ÛÓFor many of us, swiping a credit card is the height of shopping efficiency.How can we make shopping simple, fast, and safe in a post-plastic world?We spoke to Miller on the show floor here at Mobile World Congress, where the company announced a new way to finance the purchase of solar panels.""My wife only uses her contactless,"" Miller says.""She rarely has her credit card on her because her ecosystem of merchants covers that from end to end.""","['card', 'postplastic', 'uses', 'pay', 'world', 'planning', 'mobile', 'contactless', 'device', 'miller', 'credit', 'mastercard', 'ai']",,,"['About The Author', 'Dan Costa Is The Editor-In-Chief Of Pcmag.Com', 'The Senior Vice President Of Content For Ziff-Davis.

"IFC, Mastercard Foundation extend financial inclusion for millions in Africa","International Finance Corperation (IFC), together with the Mastercard Foundation, today released a new report documenting the transformation underway in financial inclusion in Sub-Saharan Africa.The findings are based on lessons learned from joint projects that have resulted in access to new digital financial services for more than seven million users on the continent over the past six years.The report, ‰Û÷Digital Access: The Future of Financial Inclusion‰Ûª highlights the phenomenal success of digital financial services in Sub-Saharan Africa and outlines the challenges still to be tackled to reach universal financial access.It captures the experience and knowledge gained by IFC and the Mastercard Foundation in supporting the growth of digital finance in Africa under the joint Partnership for Financial Inclusion since 2012.Working together with 14 microfinance institutions, banks, mobile network operators, and payments service providers across the continent, the joint initiative has resulted in 7.2 million new digital financial services users (a 250 percent increase from the baseline), 45,000 new banking agents, and $300 million in monthly transactions.‰ÛÏFinancial inclusion is one of Africa‰Ûªs great success stories of this decade. Mobile money solutions and agent banking now offer affordable, instant, and reliable transactions, savings, credit, and even insurance opportunities in rural villages and urban neighborhoods where no bank had ever established a branch,‰Ûù noted IFC‰Ûªs Chief Executive Officer Philippe Le Houerou and Mastercard Foundation President and Chief Executive Officer Reeta Roy in a joint foreword to the new report.Financial inclusion in Sub-Saharan Africa has increased dramatically over the past decade, from 23 percent in 2011 to 43 percent in 2017, according to recently released data from the World Bank Findexsurvey. Sub-Saharan Africa is the only region where the share of adults with a mobile money account exceeds 10 percent.‰ÛÏThe Partnership for Financial Inclusion has been an important actor in helping to drive financial inclusion in Africa,‰Ûù said Ruth Dueck-Mbeba, Senior Program Manager at the Mastercard Foundation. ‰ÛÏWe‰Ûªre proud of the work that our partner, IFC, has led over the past six years.It has enabled millions of people to benefit from access to financial services. More than that, the knowledge that we‰Ûªve gained will lead to millions more people improving their lives and their communities by being able to join the formal financial services sector.‰ÛùThere is an emerging body of evidence on the impact that digital financial inclusion can have on inclusive economic growth and development.A study in the report shows that smallholder cocoa farmers in CÌ«te d‰ÛªIvoire who saved regularly were better able to feed their families than those who did not save, irrespective of the farmers‰Ûª annual income.The same study also revealed that many smallholder cocoa farmers felt ‰Û÷socially excluded‰Ûª by traditional banks but were generally accepting of agent banking and digital services.Mamie Kalonda, Chief Executive Officer of FINCA in the Democratic Republic of Congo, one of the client institutions of the Partnership for Financial Inclusion, said, ‰ÛÏIn the DRC, I expect digital financial services will grow even faster in the next five years. Almost all banks are going mobile.‰Ûù She added, ‰ÛÏIt is important to reach the rural areas, because that is where people are poor.‰ÛùIn the DRC, the use of mobile money services had reached 16 percent in 2017, helping to push the overall financial inclusion rate from 3.7 percent to 26 percent in the same period.Riadh Naouar, Head of IFC‰Ûªs Financial Institutions Group Advisory in Sub-Saharan Africa, said, ‰ÛÏLooking ahead, we can see some interesting trends for the future. While East Africa has long been the star performer in terms of the evolution of digital financial services, West Africa is the new growth market. Not only in terms of reach, but also for innovation.‰Ûù‰ÛÏThere is a need in the broader industry across the continent to shift to the next generation of digital products,‰Ûù he added.‰ÛÏA broader, more multi-faceted market is asking for more sophisticated and relevant products beyond person-to-person payments. There are evident opportunities to develop digital banking, savings and credit products, as well as the digitization of value chain financing and merchant payments.‰ÛùThe report noted some of the challenges that will have to be addressed to continue progress in financial inclusion. For instance, to expand financial services to the last mile will require investments in merchant and agent networks, and innovation along agricultural value chains. As well, financial service providers will need to develop and launch products that meet an increasingly nuanced demand from an even broader variety of users, such as entrepreneurs, merchants, smallholder farmers, youth and women.For more information, please watch our videos on joint IFC and Mastercard Foundation projects in Cote d‰ÛªIvoire, Madagascar and Zambia.About the Partnership for Financial InclusionThe Partnership for Financial Inclusion is a $37.4 million joint initiative of IFC and the Mastercard Foundation to expand microfinance and advance digital financial services in Sub-Saharan Africa.It is also supported by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and the Development Bank of Austria, OeEB.","International Finance Corperation (IFC), together with the Mastercard Foundation, today released a new report documenting the transformation underway in financial inclusion in Sub-Saharan Africa.The report, ‰Û÷Digital Access: The Future of Financial Inclusion‰Ûª highlights the phenomenal success of digital financial services in Sub-Saharan Africa and outlines the challenges still to be tackled to reach universal financial access.It captures the experience and knowledge gained by IFC and the Mastercard Foundation in supporting the growth of digital finance in Africa under the joint Partnership for Financial Inclusion since 2012.‰ÛÏThe Partnership for Financial Inclusion has been an important actor in helping to drive financial inclusion in Africa,‰Ûù said Ruth Dueck-Mbeba, Senior Program Manager at the Mastercard Foundation.About the Partnership for Financial InclusionThe Partnership for Financial Inclusion is a $37.4 million joint initiative of IFC and the Mastercard Foundation to expand microfinance and advance digital financial services in Sub-Saharan Africa.","['joint', 'digital', 'services', 'millions', 'financial', 'ifc', 'inclusion', 'africa', 'partnership', 'subsaharan', 'extend', 'mastercard', 'foundation']",,,[],5/16/18 0:00,https://www.myjoyonline.com/business/2018/May-16th/ifc-mastercard-foundation-extend-financial-inclusion-for-millions-in-africa.php,,,,

Hamilton finished the game 2 for 6 on the power play while Acadie-Bathurst failed to score on three opportunities with the man advantage.Thomas‰Ûªs winner came just over a minute into the third period with a wrist shot above Fitzpatrick‰Ûªs glove.Gleason opened the scoring with a power-play goal at 14:33 of the first with a slap shot through traffic from the point.A big hit in Hamilton‰Ûªs end led to a turnover a few minutes later and the Bulldogs capitalized at the other end with Caamano slapping one past Fitzpatrick in the slot.Fitzpatrick was tested early and made a highlight-reel paddle save on Isaac Nurse just 36 seconds into the first, diving across his crease to make the stop.He had to come up strong later in the period when he misplayed a puck at the side of the net that caused a turnover and stellar opportunity.Fitzpatrick got lucky just over four minutes into the second when a one-timer from MacKenzie Entwistle went through his legs and hit the post, but stayed out.The Titan finally got one back when Truchon-Viel was left in front where he tapped in pass from Noah Dobson into a wide-open net.Acadie-Bathurst struck right back after Thomas‰Ûªs goal when Truchon-Viel launched a cross-ice pass right on top the stick tape of Asselin.

"Mastercard Open to Cryptocurrency, But There's a Catch","An executive confirms that Mastercard is open to the use of cryptocurrency, but there is a major catch involved.Banks have notoriously been steadfast in their opposition to cryptocurrencies, and this is for a very good reason. The peer-to-peer economic marketplace of digital currencies is a direct threat to the current financial monopoly held by banks and other financial institutions. Which is why it was surprising when an executive at Mastercard said that the credit card issuer was open to the overall use of cryptocurrency. However, there is a major catch to this announcement.Crypto Cold FeetMastercard has put a lot of time and effort into blockchain technology, but they‰Ûªre not exactly a fan of virtual currencies like Bitcoin. This was clearly evident when Mastercard and Visa classified the buying of cryptocurrency as a cash advance instead of a purchase.At the time, the credit card giant stated:Over the past few weeks, we have clarified to acquirers ‰ÛÒ or the merchant‰Ûªs bank ‰ÛÒ the right transaction or merchant category code to use for these type of transactions (cryptocurrency purchases). This provides a consistent view of such purchases for both merchants and issuers.The result was that using credit cards to buy Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies became more expensive. Exchanges charged a higher fee, and users began accruing interest from the moment they used a card.The CatchIt appears that the financial juggernaut has now changed their tune, but the reality is that they have not. Speaking to the Financial Times, Mastercard executive Ari Sarker says that the company is ‰ÛÏvery happy‰Ûù to consider helping the use of cryptocurrencies, but only as long as those virtual currencies are issued by central banks.Ari Sarker says:If governments look to create national digital currency we‰Ûªd be very happy to look at those in a more favourable way [compared with existing cryptocurrencies].He goes on to add:So long as it‰Ûªs backed by a regulator and the value . . . it is not anonymous, it is meeting all the regulatory requirements, I think that would be of greater interest for us to explore.Right now, the financial institution is running a pilot program in Japan and Singapore. Customers can cash out of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies onto their cards. However, Sarker says that the program is not a crypto trading one and that strict controls, such as anti-money laundering and KYC, are in place.This action by Mastercard should come as no surprise. Banks want to get their mitts on their share of the vast amount of revenue flowing through the crypto sphere, but they want to do so while exercising full control. Hence, the desire to only support cryptocurrencies issued by central banks.What do you think of this new development by Mastercard? Let us know in the comments below.Images courtesy of Bitcoinist archives, Flickr/@reynermedia, and Adobestock.","An executive confirms that Mastercard is open to the use of cryptocurrency, but there is a major catch involved.The peer-to-peer economic marketplace of digital currencies is a direct threat to the current financial monopoly held by banks and other financial institutions.Which is why it was surprising when an executive at Mastercard said that the credit card issuer was open to the overall use of cryptocurrency.Crypto Cold FeetMastercard has put a lot of time and effort into blockchain technology, but they‰Ûªre not exactly a fan of virtual currencies like Bitcoin.This was clearly evident when Mastercard and Visa classified the buying of cryptocurrency as a cash advance instead of a purchase.","['cryptocurrency', 'currencies', 'financial', 'executive', 'virtual', 'theres', 'sarker', 'bitcoin', 'cryptocurrencies', 'open', 'credit', 'catch', 'mastercard']",,,['Jeff Francis'],2018-03-19 03:30:08-04:00,http://bitcoinist.com/mastercard-open-cryptocurrency-theres-catch/,,,,

NHL Draft 2018: Will The Blue Jackets Continue to Avoid the Canadian Hockey League?,"The Blue Jackets had a unique draft in 2017.For the first time in the team‰Ûªs history, they did not select a player from the Canadian Hockey League. The CHL, consisting of the Western Hockey League, the Ontario Hockey League and the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League, is the largest junior hockey league in the world and the biggest feeder system to the NHL.There were 217 players picked in the draft in 2017, using Hockey-Reference‰Ûªs play index, 89 players (41%) were selected from the CHL.As I briefly mentioned in my mailbag, there are some benefits to this ideology.You control a non-CHL player‰Ûªs rights for four years vs. two years for CHL players, and you are able to sign CHL players as undrafted free agents and as over-age free agents. We have seen the Blue Jackets take advantage of these rules recently, signing Maxime Fortier, Justin Scott, Jordan Maletta and Dante Salituro. Players drafted from the CHL are also unable to play in the AHL. The CHL and NHL have an agreement that any player picked from the CHL has to either player in the NHL or be returned to their junior club. Vitali Abramov was a victim of this rule in 2017-18; he was clearly ready to make the jump to professional hockey, but since he didn‰Ûªt make the Blue Jackets, it was back to the QMJHL.What has me fascinated is if we're going to start seeing this more and more of this with teams (as scouting budgets grow and scouts are able to travel further and further around the globe). We saw two other teams do this last season, as neither Buffalo or Washington selected a CHL player. Over the last 10 drafts we have seen a steady decline in CHL players drafted.In 2008 and 2010, over 50% of the players drafted were from the CHL. Since, there has been a consistent albeit small decline in players taken from the CHL. This season, there was a huge drop ‰ÛÒ which was rather unexpected, considering there was an extra team (Vegas) and thus seven additional picks.Why did this happen? A few reasons. The CHL is still a strong development league, but now, other junior leagues around the world are becoming stronger and represent a viable alternative to the CHL. We've seen Russia implement the MHL, and Sweden and Finland continue to have strong junior leagues within their borders. In the United States, the USHL has grown into a quality league and option for American-born players who aren‰Ûªt selected to play for the USNTDP program. With the success of USHL graduates like Kyle Connor and Brock Boeser, the league is going to continue to grow and get better.Countries are doing everything they can to keep their players at home, and it's working. I think players are starting to realize you don‰Ûªt need to be playing in Canada to be seen. If you are good enough, no matter where you play, the scouts will find you.This is not to say the CHL is a bad league, because it‰Ûªs not. The Blue Jackets top center' in Pierre-Luc Dubois and top prospect in Abramov were both drafted and developed through the CHL system. Teams simply are realizing the added benefits that come with players from other leagues, especially late in the draft; you can take a chance on a player late and give them as much development time as needed, since you have those extra years of control.This draft will be very telling. Will the drop in CHL players selected continue, or was last year just a one-off?Follow 1st Ohio BatteryFacebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube","For the first time in the team‰Ûªs history, they did not select a player from the Canadian Hockey League.The CHL, consisting of the Western Hockey League, the Ontario Hockey League and the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League, is the largest junior hockey league in the world and the biggest feeder system to the NHL.You control a non-CHL player‰Ûªs rights for four years vs. two years for CHL players, and you are able to sign CHL players as undrafted free agents and as over-age free agents.We saw two other teams do this last season, as neither Buffalo or Washington selected a CHL player.Will the drop in CHL players selected continue, or was last year just a one-off?","['continue', 'blue', '2018', 'chl', 'players', 'jackets', 'draft', 'nhl', 'player', 'avoid', 'teams', 'seen', 'hockey', 'selected', 'canadian', 'play', 'junior', 'league']",,,[],5/22/18 0:00,https://www.1stohiobattery.com/columbus-blue-jackets-prospects/2018/05/2294/blue-jackets-draft-philosophy-will-they-continue-to-avoid-the-chl,,,,

Titan fend off late rally to beat Pats at Mastercard Memorial Cup,"REGINA ‰ÛÓ The Acadie-Bathurst Titan talked in their dressing room during the second intermission about continuing to press the Regina Pats despite a four-goal advantage.The Quebec Major Junior Hockey League champion went on to allow four goals in the third Sunday, but held on for an 8-6 victory over the hosts at the Mastercard Memorial Cup.Titan captain Jeffrey Truchon-Viel said his team let up in the third.""We talked about it after the second that we cannot stop working and that‰Ûªs what we did,"" said Truchon-Viel, who had two goals and an assist.""It‰Ûªs a good lesson for us.""Acadie-Bathurst (2-0) earned a berth in Friday‰Ûªs semifinal of the Canadian major junior championship with the victory.Noah Dobson led the Titan offensive attack with two goals and two assists, including an empty-netter in the dying seconds.

Samuel Asselin also chipped in.Dobson said that his team fell asleep in the third period.""But a win‰Ûªs a win in this tournament,"" he said. ""I think if we said at the start of the tournament to be 2-0 after the first two games, I think we‰Ûªd take it.""The Pats‰Ûª rally started shortly after Crossman‰Ûªs second goal to make it 7-2.Cameron Hebig‰Ûªs second of the game followed by a power-play goal from Nick Henry closed the deficit to three.

Miguel GamiÌ±o Joins Mastercard to Lead City Partnerships,"For seven years, Miguel GamiÌ±o worked in technology leadership for some of the largest cities in the U.S. ‰ÛÓ first El Paso, Texas, then San Francisco, then New York.Now, he‰Ûªs going to be in charge of forming relationships with cities like those and figuring out their problems from the outside, as executive vice president for global cities at Mastercard.‰ÛÏWe want to be a thoughtful listener and partner with the cities to surface what [their problems] are,‰Ûù GamiÌ±o said. ‰ÛÏAnd where those problems intersect with our strengths, that‰Ûªs the sweet spot.‰ÛùThus far, the main thrust of Mastercard‰Ûªs recent work with cities has been in transportation ‰ÛÓ transit in particular. It‰Ûªs worked with Chicago to try to figure out how to get baseball fans to flock to a stadium over a longer span of time instead of all at once. It‰Ûªs partnered with Mexico City to offer more digital payment capabilities for buses and trains. And it‰Ûªs pushing payment solutions for people without bank accounts, as well as economic activity data to help urban planners.But GamiÌ±o, who will be based out of New York City for his new job, wants to keep pushing into other areas. And he wants to do it by talking with people in local government about the problems their constituents are facing.‰ÛÏI think [Mastercard has] a lot of resources and knowledge and expertise in facilitating those interactions between people, and between people and services and that sort of thing,‰Ûù he said. ‰ÛÏSo I think this is really about leveraging that underlying asset and strength to figure out how cities can make progress with the existing assets they have.‰ÛùData will likely play a big role in that mission. And as a company that handles a lot of financial transactions, Mastercard has a lot of data.GamiÌ±o describes it as ‰ÛÏvery wide sets of experiential data.‰Ûù For example, Mastercard has an initiative it calls SpendingPulse, which is a macroeconomic indicator tool based on retail spending. The city of Dublin, Ireland, recently turned to the tool to supplement its information on economic growth.The company has been emphasizing partnerships with other non-governmental entities as well.

Mastercard Pilots 'Pay As You Go' Program For Solar Energy In Africa,"Mastercard Pilots 'Pay As You Go' Program For Solar Energy In AfricaThere‰Ûªs a lot of untapped potential when it comes to solar energy in Africa. Solutions have come to the continent on a small and rural scale, but it remains very expensive to implement. Mastercard is teaming up with a solar energy company to help the population pay for solar generation based on consumption.Africa receives the most amount of sunshine than any other continent on Earth. Most of that is beamed at the Sahara Desert, but there‰Ûªs still a number of African countries south of the desert that can utilize the sunlight. At the same time, over 600 million people don‰Ûªt have access to electricity.M-Kopa Solar, a Kenyan energy company that focuses on bringing electricity to everyone, has already rolled out a ‰ÛÏpay-as-you-go‰Ûù plan in East Africa for a trial run. This prevents the need for people to pay for large solar energy costs immediately and instead make small daily payments on their account.While a great alternative, many rural areas in Africa lack the banking infrastructure to bring this technology over. This is where Mastercard comes in, using their QR codes for customers to pay for their energy usage. Instead of needing cash or cards, all they need is a mobile device to make a payment -- which is powered from the solar energy they receive.Solar panels will have unique device IDs and QR codes on them, and payments will be made through a telco app. M-Kopa Solar doesn‰Ûªt need to upgrade any of their technology since a number of places in Africa have Masterpass QR already available, including Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Uganda.‰ÛÏWe‰Ûªve proven that the pay-as-you-go solar model works in East Africa, but the off-grid market in Africa is tremendous. Our partnership with Mastercard provides the roadway for more solar services and infrastructure across the continent,‰Ûù Nick Hughes, co-founder and chief product officer of M-Kopa Solar, told PV-Tech.Without the pay-as-you-go program, it would cost Africans nearly $200 to purchase and install M-Kopa‰Ûªs solar products. The installment plan shrinks this to a $35 down payment and a daily cost that can go down to five cents per day. This would also be an interest-free plan, and if consumers are able to keep up with payments, they‰Ûªll build credit to purchase other products.","Mastercard Pilots 'Pay As You Go' Program For Solar Energy In AfricaThere‰Ûªs a lot of untapped potential when it comes to solar energy in Africa.Mastercard is teaming up with a solar energy company to help the population pay for solar generation based on consumption.This prevents the need for people to pay for large solar energy costs immediately and instead make small daily payments on their account.This is where Mastercard comes in, using their QR codes for customers to pay for their energy usage.‰ÛÏWe‰Ûªve proven that the pay-as-you-go solar model works in East Africa, but the off-grid market in Africa is tremendous.","['need', 'energy', 'pay', 'payasyougo', 'solar', 'payments', 'africa', 'plan', 'qr', 'program', 'mastercard', 'pilots']",,,[],2/26/18 0:00,http://www.greenmatters.com/news/2018/02/26/Z2jGlsn/mastercard-africa-solar-energy,,,,

Investor‰Ûªs Roundup (PEG Analysis) ‰ÛÒ Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) ‰ÛÒ Nasdaq Journal,"Shares of Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) closed the previous trading session at $192.99, experiencing a change of 0.71% with 2,449,988 shares trading hands. The stock holds an average trading capacity of 3.87M shares for the past three months. When we compare its current volume with average for the same time of day, a Relative Volume (usually displayed as ratio) of 0.63 is obtained. It is kind of a like a radar for how ‰ÛÏin-play‰Ûù a stock is. The higher the relative volume is the more in play it is because more traders are watching and trading it. This is something that Investors should look for in all the stocks they are trading and is an important indicator to keep tabs on.Is The Stock Safe to Invest? (Market Capitalization Analysis):Now investors want to know the actual market worth of the company in the Stock Market. Market worth or Market capitalization is calculated by multiplying the price of a stock by its total number of outstanding shares. As a company has 1.05B shares outstanding and its current share price is $192.99, the market cap is $202.48B. From a safety point of view, a company‰Ûªs size and market value do matter. All things being equal, large cap stocks are considered safer than small cap stocks. However, small cap stocks have greater potential for growth.Although market capitalization is key to consider, don‰Ûªt invest (or not invest) based solely on it. It‰Ûªs just one measure of value. As a serious shareholder, you need to look at plentiful factors that can assist you determine whether any given stock is a good investment.Is The Stock A Good Investment? (P/E Analysis):Price-earnings ratio, also known as P/E ratio, is a tool that is used by shareholders to help decide whether they should buy a stock. Basically, the P/E ratio tells potential shareholders how much they have to pay for every $1 of earnings. The formula for calculating the price-earnings ratio for any stock is simple: the market value per share divided by the earnings per share (EPS). This is represented as the equation (P/EPS), where P is the market price and EPS is the earnings per share. As the current market price of the stock is $192.99 and diluted EPS for the trailing twelve month is 4.79, the P/E ratio for the stock comes out as 40.29.Generally, shareholders love stocks with a low price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. The perception is that the lower the P/E, the higher will be the value of the stock. The simple logic that a stock‰Ûªs current market price does not justify (is not equivalent to) its higher earnings and therefore has room to run is behind shareholders‰Ûª inclination toward low P/E stocks.Price/Earnings to Growth ‰ÛÒ PEG Ratio Analysis:The price/earnings to growth ratio (PEG ratio) is a stock‰Ûªs price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio divided by the growth rate of its earnings for a specified time period. For now, the company has PEG ratio of 1.88. The PEG ratio is used to determine a stock‰Ûªs value while taking the company‰Ûªs earnings growth into account, and is considered to provide a more complete picture than the P/E ratio.Despite the fact that a low P/E ratio may make a stock look like a good buy, factoring in the company‰Ûªs growth rate to get the stock‰Ûªs PEG ratio can tell a different story. The lower the PEG ratio, the more the stock may be undervalued given its earnings performance. The degree to which a PEG ratio value indicates an over or underpriced stock varies by industry and by company type; though a broad rule of thumb is that a PEG ratio below one is desirable. Also, the accuracy of the PEG ratio depends on the inputs used. Using historical growth rates, for example, may provide an inaccurate PEG ratio if future growth rates are predictable to deviate from historical growth rates. To distinguish between calculation methods using future growth and historical growth, the terms ‰ÛÏforward PEG‰Ûù and ‰ÛÏtrailing PEG‰Ûù are sometimes used.Stock‰Ûªs Liquidity Analysis:Presently, 0.10% shares of Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) are owned by insiders with -23.56% six-month change in the insider ownership. The insider filler data counts the number of monthly positions over 3 month and 12 month time spans. Short-term as well long term shareholders always focus on the liquidity of the stocks so for that concern, liquidity measure in recent quarter results of the company was recorded 1.60 as current ratio and on the opponent side the debt to equity ratio was 1.13 and long-term debt to equity ratio also remained 1.13.Brief Overview on Stock‰Ûªs Performances:The stock showed weekly performance of 0.32%, which was maintained for the month at 11.40%. Likewise, the performance for the quarter was recorded as 11.59% and for the year was 61.36%. Analysts‰Ûª mean recommendation for the stock is 1.70 (A rating of less than 2 means buy, ‰ÛÏhold‰Ûù within the 3 range, ‰ÛÏsell‰Ûù within the 4 range, and ‰ÛÏstrong sell‰Ûù within the 5 range).Disclaimer: Any news, report, research and analysis published on Nasdaqjournal.com are only for information purposes.

"Comparing The Gap, Inc. (GPS) and Mastercard Incorporated (MA) ‰ÛÒ Stock News Gazette","The Gap, Inc. (NYSE:GPS) shares are down more than -6.93% this year and recently increased 0.41% or $0.13 to settle at $31.70. Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), on the other hand, is up 26.32% year to date as of 05/21/2018. It currently trades at $191.20 and has returned -0.48% during the past week.The Gap, Inc. (NYSE:GPS) and Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) are the two most active stocks in the Apparel Stores industry based on today‰Ûªs trading volumes. To determine if one is a better investment than the other, we will compare the two companies‰Ûª growth, profitability, risk, return, and valuation characteristics, as well as their analyst ratings and sentiment signals.Companies that can consistently grow earnings at a high compound rate usually have the greatest potential to create value for shareholders in the long-run. Analysts expect GPS to grow earnings at a 10.83% annual rate over the next 5 years. Comparatively, MA is expected to grow at a 21.48% annual rate. All else equal, MA‰Ûªs higher growth rate would imply a greater potential for capital appreciation.Growth doesn‰Ûªt mean much if it comes at the cost of weak profitability. To adjust for differences in capital structure we‰Ûªll use EBITDA margin and Return on Investment (ROI) as measures of profitability and return. , compared to an EBITDA margin of 24.04% for Mastercard Incorporated (MA). GPS‰Ûªs ROI is 21.30% while MA has a ROI of 44.00%. The interpretation is that MA‰Ûªs business generates a higher return on investment than GPS‰Ûªs.Earnings don‰Ûªt always accurately reflect the amount of cash that a company brings in. GPS‰Ûªs free cash flow (‰ÛÏFCF‰Ûù) per share for the trailing twelve months was +1.08. Comparatively, MA‰Ûªs free cash flow per share was +0.79. On a percent-of-sales basis, GPS‰Ûªs free cash flow was 2.65% while MA converted 6.6% of its revenues into cash flow. This means that, for a given level of sales, MA is able to generate more free cash flow for investors.Analysts look at liquidity and leverage ratios to assess how easily a company can cover its liabilities. GPS has a current ratio of 1.90 compared to 1.60 for MA. This means that GPS can more easily cover its most immediate liabilities over the next twelve months. GPS‰Ûªs debt-to-equity ratio is 0.40 versus a D/E of 1.13 for MA. MA is therefore the more solvent of the two companies, and has lower financial risk.GPS trades at a forward P/E of 11.48, a P/B of 3.90, and a P/S of 0.77, compared to a forward P/E of 25.87, a P/B of 35.21, and a P/S of 15.03 for MA. GPS is the cheaper of the two stocks on an earnings, book value and sales basis. Given that earnings are what matter most to investors, analysts tend to place a greater weight on the P/E.Analyst Price Targets and OpinionsInvestors often compare a stock‰Ûªs current price to an analyst price target to get a sense of the potential upside within the next year. GPS is currently priced at a -6.82% to its one-year price target of 34.02. Comparatively, MA is -2.49% relative to its price target of 196.09. This suggests that GPS is the better investment over the next year.Risk and VolatilityBeta is an important measure that gives investors a sense of the market risk associated with a particular stock. A beta above 1 signals above average market risk, while a beta below 1 implies below average volatility. GPS has a beta of 0.84 and MA‰Ûªs beta is 1.18. GPS‰Ûªs shares are therefore the less volatile of the two stocks.Short interest is another tool that analysts use to gauge investor sentiment. It represents the percentage of a stock‰Ûªs tradable shares that are being shorted. GPS has a short ratio of 6.01 compared to a short interest of 1.75 for MA. This implies that the market is currently less bearish on the outlook for MA.The Gap, Inc. (NYSE:GPS) beats Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) on a total of 8 of the 14 factors compared between the two stocks. GPS has higher cash flow per share, higher liquidity and has lower financial risk. In terms of valuation, GPS is the cheaper of the two stocks on an earnings, book value and sales basis, GPS is more undervalued relative to its price target. Finally, CBS has better sentiment signals based on short interest.","On a percent-of-sales basis, GPS‰Ûªs free cash flow was 2.65% while MA converted 6.6% of its revenues into cash flow.This means that, for a given level of sales, MA is able to generate more free cash flow for investors.GPS is currently priced at a -6.82% to its one-year price target of 34.02.The Gap, Inc.

How mobile money could help the world's poor,"MastercardThis story is part of ""Follow the Money,"" a look at how digital cash is changing the way we save, shop and work.John Kunze walked into a check-cashing store along Lexington Avenue in Manhattan a few months ago. It had red neon signs in the windows, cold fluorescent lights and a loop of muzak piping through the speakers. He wasn't impressed.The PayPal executive pointed to a wall poster showing the store charged $1 to cash a $25 check, up to $40.60 for $2,000. ""That would be kind of neat if we could put checks into PayPal and not charge that number,"" he says about the higher figure.Kunze hit on a reality that billions of people worldwide know too well: Being poor can cost you a lot of money. About 2 billion people, including an estimated 9 million US households, don't have bank accounts or access to a financial institution. According to the World Bank, about 20 percent of these ""unbanked"" adults get their wages and pay their bills in cash. That's risky and makes it harder to save, two reasons the Gates Foundation sees digital money -- which can be received and transferred using even the simplest feature phones -- as key to helping break the cycle of poverty.Now payments and tech heavyweights including PayPal, Mastercard, Amazon and Samsung, along with a growing list of financial tech startups, are working to offer more banklike services -- including apps, mobile systems and cryptocurrencies -- to those often ignored by traditional banks. But providing new financial services to those who never had them comes with challenges.Now Playing: Watch this: Mobile payments are a mess. Here's whyTech companies will have to educate people on the basics of these payment systems, such as remembering a PIN and how they can deposit, withdraw and send money, the World Bank says. Companies will also have to shell out the upfront costs for a reliable payments infrastructure, or few will use it. And they'll have to prove to consumers that their services are trustworthy and safe. Kenya's M-Pesa mobile money system shows it can be done.Launched 11 years by Safaricom, the country's largest mobile telecom operator, M-Pesa is now used by more than two-thirds of Kenya's adults. M-Pesa offers a glimpse of how other systems could work. In Kenya, you simply hand cash to one of Safaricom's agents (often in the same shop selling airtime), who credits that money to your M-Pesa account. Transferring money is as simple as calling up a menu on your feature phone.""I think the [unbanked] numbers will go down, but how we judge them will change as well,"" says Mike Elliott, a Mastercard executive focused on giving more people access to payment and money transfer tools, often referred to financial inclusion. But access is just the first step, he says. How an account will actually be used will be even more important.Unbanked in AfricaElliott oversees a Mastercard lab in Nairobi, Kenya, that's funded by the Gates Foundation. There, the 22-person team prototypes and commercializes financial products for the developing world. The scale of the mission is huge, since about 85 percent of transactions worldwide are still done in cash.One of these efforts is called Kionect, a new way mom-and-pop shopkeepers in Kenya can buy supplies via text messages on their feature phones. Used by 1,500 retailers, the system helps shops build up financial histories they can then use to gain access to credit, loans and insurance.Shashank Bengali/MCT via Getty Images""People are really familiar with cash, and that's the challenge for us,"" says Elliott. ""People don't wake up in the morning saying, 'I really want to make a digital payment.'""Then there's Samsung's Contactless Companion Platform, or CCP. Introduced last year, the system uses NFC technology that lets a phone, wearable or key fob make small digital payments.Samsung initially viewed the system as a way to help adults in Europe and the US give their kids some pocket money. But the Germany-based engineers who designed it -- all with bank accounts, credit cards and smartphones -- didn't anticipate how far this idea would resonate.""Over the last 12 months, we've received inquiries from all over the world,"" Samsung's Thomas Arenz says.Samsung ran a pilot program in East Africa, where mobile money networks, such as Kenya's M-Pesa, are already widely used. Two more pilots -- one in the Bahamas dubbed ""Island Pay,"" and another in Central America -- are set to kick off in the coming months.Crypto for allCryptocurrencies like bitcoin offer another option for serving the world's unbanked.Sebastian Serrano, CEO and co-founder of Ripio in Argentina, is on the forefront of this effort.Via RipioRipio offers a mobile bitcoin wallet and a cryptocurrency-based loan network in Argentina and Brazil, countries where banking and credit customers pay high interest rates, have fewer banking options and struggle with unstable currencies, he says.""Our mission is to give access to this new network of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, and use it as a tool for financial inclusion,"" Serrano says.Similar to Prosper or Lending Club, Serrano's company allows regular folks to lend money using cryptocurrencies that are converted to Ripio's own digital coin, called RCN, and converted again into a local currency. The process allows Ripio to offer the service to lenders all over the world, not just local markets.Sure, people from countries with a stable currency may scoff at investing their nest eggs in bitcoin. But Serrano says that, despite its own volatility, virtual currency can be a safer bet than the Argentine peso, which suffers from rapid inflation and repeated collapse.""You know for sure it will lose value,"" he said of the peso. ""There is an outlook for bitcoin to appreciate.""Greta Bull, a director at the World Bank and CEO of the Consultative Group to Assist the Poor, disagrees. She doesn't think bitcoin is the right tool for enable financial inclusion.""If you look at markets like Africa, you still have to get cash in and out of the system,"" she says. ""People can't go and buy feed for their cattle using bitcoin.""Others are using bitcoin's underlying technology, called blockchain, to offer new financial tools. Take Bitt, a startup in Barbados that has created a merchant network of 240 retail sites on the island nation. People can use this network to load Barbados dollars into a digital cash account, accessible through Bitt's free app. They can then use the app to pay utility bills or purchase something from a retailer in Bitt's network. Bitt charges retailers 1 percent for digital transactions, roughly half of what Visa and Mastercard charge, says Bitt CEO Rawdon Adams.Both Bitt and Ripio use blockchain to cut out middlemen and costs. The software distributes information across multiple computers and hard-wires trust into transactions, reducing the need for more expensive payment networks.CNET Daily News Get today's top news and reviews collected for you.Bitt also lets customers buy and sell bitcoin, but for regulatory reasons doesn't allow retail sales using the cryptocurrency.""We want to offer something like a bank on a phone,"" Adams says. ""I don't think anything will displace cash in this region. But it's faster, cheaper and more secure than cash in many cases.""Digital inclusionPayPal's Kunze didn't mention it at the check-cashing store, but his company was already developing a new digital check cashing feature.Graphic by Aaron Robinson/CNETEarlier this month he said PayPal started testing the service, which charges 1 percent per deposit -- about half the fee charged by the check-cashing place -- or free with direct deposit.PayPal is also testing a prepaid card from Mastercard.Amazon, too, created a way for more customers to shop on its website, launching Amazon Cash. The service lets people instantly add money to their Amazon accounts when visiting more than 10,000 US retail locations. PayPal offers a similar service at more 20,000 stores.""Our job isn't to put these alternative financial service providers out of business,"" Kunze says about check-cashing businesses. ""It's to provide customers with more options.""Bull from the World Bank argues that ""technology is the easy part."" Simply telling people their lives will be better if they embrace these new services doesn't always work.""Behavior change sometimes requires a bit of a jolt,"" she says.Tech Enabled: CNET chronicles tech's role in providing new kinds of accessibility.Blockchain Decoded: CNET looks at the tech powering bitcoin -- and soon, too, a myriad of services that will change your life.","MastercardThis story is part of ""Follow the Money,"" a look at how digital cash is changing the way we save, shop and work.Kenya's M-Pesa mobile money system shows it can be done.Samsung ran a pilot program in East Africa, where mobile money networks, such as Kenya's M-Pesa, are already widely used.Greta Bull, a director at the World Bank and CEO of the Consultative Group to Assist the Poor, disagrees.People can use this network to load Barbados dollars into a digital cash account, accessible through Bitt's free app.","['cash', 'help', 'digital', 'world', 'financial', 'system', 'poor', 'mobile', 'bitcoin', 'bank', 'using', 'money', 'worlds']",,,[],2018-04-25 05:00:00-07:00,https://www.cnet.com/news/how-mobile-money-could-help-the-worlds-poor/,,,,
Mastercard sets biometric ID deadline for banks,"Mastercard has set a deadline of April 2019 for widespread use of biometric identification for users of its service.The payments company said all of its customers would be able to use biometrics, including fingerprint and facial recognition, by next April.Banks that accept Mastercard payments will have to support these identification mechanisms, in addition to PINs and passwords, to allow customers to make payments remotely.Download this free guide 6 ways blockchain will be used in the future In this e-guide, read about how blockchain's inherent security makes it a key player in the future of tech yet is still susceptible to spammers and phishers.

This is a technological advance from a password a customer knows combined with a card or device they have, to a mobile device they have combined with what they are (biometrics).‰ÛÏBiometric technologies perfectly meet the public‰Ûªs expectation for state-of-the-art security when making a payment,‰Ûù said Mark Barnett, president at Mastercard UK. ‰ÛÏThis will be of great benefit to everyone: consumers, retailers and banks. It will make the purchase much smoother, and instead of having to remember passwords to authenticate, shoppers will have the chance to use a fingerprint or a picture of themselves.‰ÛùRead more about biometric authentication Lloyds Banking Group is testing out biometric authentication technology from Microsoft for online banking.Mobile banking customers of TSB using the latest Samsung mobile devices are now able to access their accounts though an iris scanner.British people have most trust in banks to provide biometric security with payments, according to research from Visa.One of the advantages identified by Mastercard is that biometric authentication makes it easier for the consumer, and therefore less likely that they will abandon an online or mobile purchase before completion.Changing customer behaviour has forced payment services companies to invest in the latest digital technologies.Mastercard, for example, has been investing in biometric security technology since 2014, when it announced that, alongside Zwipe, it was developing a payment card with a built-in fingerprint authentication sensor. A year later it announced a biometric authentication and verification pilot, as part of a $20m increase in spending on improving its cyber security technology.","Banks that accept Mastercard payments will have to support these identification mechanisms, in addition to PINs and passwords, to allow customers to make payments remotely.Start Download Corporate E-mail Address: You forgot to provide an Email Address.Citing research it carried out with Oxford University, Mastercard said 92% of banking professionals wanted to introduce biometric ID and 93% of consumers would prefer biometric security to passwords.It will make the purchase much smoother, and instead of having to remember passwords to authenticate, shoppers will have the chance to use a fingerprint or a picture of themselves.‰ÛùRead more about biometric authentication Lloyds Banking Group is testing out biometric authentication technology from Microsoft for online banking.British people have most trust in banks to provide biometric security with payments, according to research from Visa.","['payment', 'banks', 'biometric', 'deadline', 'id', 'sets', 'authentication', 'payments', 'mobile', 'address', 'email', 'provide', 'mastercard', 'security']",,,"['Emea Content Editor', 'Computer Weekly']",,https://www.computerweekly.com/news/252433622/Mastercard-sets-biometric-ID-deadline-for-banks,,,,
"Mastercard, Unilever to introduce Digital Lending Platform in Africa ‰ÛÒ New Business Ethiopia","Mastercard and Unilever extend partnership to help micro entrepreneurs in Africa and other regions overcome the cash constraints that limit their ability to buy and sell more products and ultimately grow their businesses.In Kenya, the two companies have launched Jaza Duka (‰ÛÏfill up your store‰Ûù). The initiative combines distribution data from Unilever and analysis by Mastercard, on how much inventory a store has bought from Unilever over time.The results from the analysis are used to provide a micro-credit eligibility recommendation to KCB Bank Kenya (KCB). This solves for the problem that banks usually require formal credit history or collateral, resulting in entrepreneurs borrowing from informal lenders at high interest rates and trapping them in a cycle of debt.If the micro-credit line from KCB is approved, the store owner is able to increase their purchases of product from what they can buy with cash on hand to what they can actually sell. For example, if a store is consistently showing weekly purchases of $50 from Unilever they could qualify for an interest-free credit line of $120 to stock their inventory. The credit line from KCB is provided through a secure Mastercard digital payment solution.As part of the micro-credit, the partners are providing the store owners with training to help them manage their finances, inventory and forward planning for supply against demand. The entrepreneurs are also being trained on marketing tools and techniques to help sell their products and subsequently increase their opportunity to grow faster. Local communities can also benefit from having quicker, more reliable access to the products they need most to support their families.By the end of April, more than 5,000 kiosk owners in the wider Nairobi area had applied to join the program ‰ÛÒ all are expected to be fully enrolled by mid-May. Stores that fully moved to the new platform have grown their sales of Unilever products by up to 20 percent.‰ÛÏMicro and small businesses are the economic backbone of communities around the world,‰Ûù said Ajay Banga, president and CEO, Mastercard.‰ÛÏThere‰Ûªs an opportunity to set these businesses up for long-term growth by bringing together the tools and data from different industries to change the model of small business financing. We invite other companies and private sector leaders to join us in this collaborative approach and create a true network effect that will bring down barriers and trigger change.‰Ûù‰ÛÏFinancial inclusion is a key enabler of the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals ‰ÛÒ lifting individuals out of poverty and supporting overall economic growth. By broadening our collaboration with Mastercard, working across sectors and including additional private and public partners, we are further expanding the positive impact of financial and economic inclusion‰Ûù said Paul Polman, chief executive, Unilever.Over time, the payment history from shopkeepers‰Ûª participation in Jaza Duka can pave the way for these business owners to access other financial services, including small business loans.In order to further scale this model, Mastercard and Unilever jointly commit to a number of actions:The companies have set a target to provide 20,000 kiosks in Kenya with a digitally managed credit solution by end of the year. These efforts are expected to extend to additional markets across Africa and Asia Pacific.To ensure responsible use of credit, the Center for Inclusive Growth ‰ÛÒ a Mastercardphilanthropic initiative ‰ÛÒ will work with TechnoServe to provide micro-entrepreneurs with training on financial and business skills.Mastercard will join Unilever in its ‰ÛÏTransform‰Ûù partnership with the UK Department for International Development (DFID), with the aim to promote sustainable community development in emerging markets around the world.‰ÛÏWe see this partnership as a big plus in boosting our role as catalysts of trade and doing business in East Africa. This is part of our commitment to simplify and transform the lives of our customers to enable their progress. The retailers can now access their credit using their mobile phones without the need to issue physical plastic cards. Following a successful deployment in Kenya, we will be rolling out the same to the regional markets we are in as we support the growth of value chains, small, medium and micro enterprises,‰Ûù said KCB Group CEO and MD Joshua Oigara.The CEOs invite other financial institutions and complementary consumer packaged goods suppliers to join the initiative to help fuel micro and small business growth across the world.","The initiative combines distribution data from Unilever and analysis by Mastercard, on how much inventory a store has bought from Unilever over time.The results from the analysis are used to provide a micro-credit eligibility recommendation to KCB Bank Kenya (KCB).Stores that fully moved to the new platform have grown their sales of Unilever products by up to 20 percent.Over time, the payment history from shopkeepers‰Ûª participation in Jaza Duka can pave the way for these business owners to access other financial services, including small business loans.The CEOs invite other financial institutions and complementary consumer packaged goods suppliers to join the initiative to help fuel micro and small business growth across the world.","['kcb', 'small', 'products', 'business', 'kenya', 'digital', 'ethiopia', 'africa', 'introduce', 'unilever', 'growth', 'lending', 'credit', 'mastercard', 'platform', 'store']",,,[],,https://newbusinessethiopia.com/mastercard-unilever-to-introduce-digital-lending-platform-in-africa/,,,,
PelÌ© and Mastercard Find Unity Between Soccer Rivals in ‰Û÷22 Languages‰Ûª Campaign,"Soccer can bring people together despite their differences, says a new campaign from Mastercard starring 22 fans from around the globe, as well as Brazilian great PelÌ©.The three-minute ad, created by McCann New York and McCann Worldgroup Europe, opens by interviewing men from different countries who share two common traits‰ÛÓa love of football, and a healthy dose of nationalist bravado.As they slather on the smack talk, it becomes clear they‰Ûªre not just sounding off about how England produces better players than Germany, or musing on whether Argentinians have a misplaced sense of superiority. They‰Ûªre preparing to compete in a friendly game. The prize? Eleven tickets to the UEFA Champions League‰ÛÓone for each player on the winning team.After euphoric footage of the match, with a mysterious spectator clapping in the stands, the winners retire to the locker room. There, they discover PelÌ©, waiting to hand out gems of wisdom‰ÛÓand tickets‰ÛÓto both teams.‰ÛÏThe purpose of football is, no doubt, to put people together,‰Ûù he says. ‰ÛÏWe have a different philosophy of life, different languages ‰Û_ but we all have the same emotions, the same feelings.‰ÛùIn the end, even the Italian and the Frenchman‰ÛÓseen viciously deriding each other at the beginning of the ad, titled ‰ÛÏ22 Languages‰Ûù‰ÛÓare laughing and high-fiving.PelÌ©, meanwhile, testifies to the poignant nature of the scene.

"How Lyft, Mastercard, and Drone Companies Are Experimenting With Artificial Intelligence","Artificial intelligence technologies aren‰Ûªt just being used to help computers more quickly recognize dogs in photos.Several businesses like Mastercard and fast-growing drone companies are exploring ways that AI technologies like machine learning can better verify people‰Ûªs identities and process insurance claims.Executives from companies like ride-hailing company Lyft and German energy company Innogy, a subsidiary of energy giant RWE, explained different ways they are exploring AI technologies on Thursday at the BootstrapLabs Applied AI Conference in San Francisco.Here‰Ûªs some interesting ways these businesses are using the technology.1. Insurance Companies Want to Speed Up Claims Processing Using DronesDuring the past few years, insurance companies like Allstate have been using drones to inspect homes for storm damage. One reason is that inspecting home rooftops is one of the most dangerous jobs, said drone startup Kespry CEO George Mathew.Following hurricanes Harvey and Irma last year, Kespry helped insurance companies that he did not name take aerial photos of damaged home rooftops. After snapping the pictures, the drone wirelessly transmits the images to data centers, where machine learning technology helps identify damage to homes.Currently, it takes about 75 minutes to process a claim, but insurance companies want to trim it to 25 minutes per drone flight, Mathew explained. To things speed up, Mathew is considering installing the same computer chips used to improve video game visuals, GPUs, into the company‰Ûªs drones because they are good with handling machine learning tasks.2. Using Artificial Intelligence to Power the Electrical Grids of the FutureThe future, according to German energy company Innogy executive Thomas Birr, may involve powerful electrical grids that are linked to everything from Internet-connected dishwashers to solar panels to electric cars.As more devices are connected online, Birr says that electrical grids will need artificial intelligence technologies to more efficiently distribute power. He wants to avoid situations in which several people charging their electric cars on the same city street may overload the power grid.For example, using artificial intelligence technologies, Birr said that energy companies could better predict the weather and notify customers who have Internet-connected electric cars when it is a good time to charge their vehicles without overloading the system.3. Artificial intelligence Supercharging CybersecurityWill Summerlin, the founder of Pinn Technologies, is exploring how AI can be used to prevent fraud and better verify customer identities.Consider modern-day smartphones that are outfitted with sensors that can capture information like how people swipe their display screens or hold their devices. By correlating that data with information like a person‰Ûªs palm print or other so-called biometric data, financial services companies could better verify their identity when making online payments.Get Data Sheet, Fortune‰Ûªs technology newsletter.It‰Ûªs an idea that Mastercard security executive Chris Merz acknowledged that his company is looking into.4. One Reason Lyft Is Testing Self-Driving CarsOne reason ride-hailing company Lyft is testing self-driving cars is to help the company expand into more rural areas.Nadeem Sheikh, the vice president of Lyft‰Ûªs self-driving car program, said that it‰Ûªs currently too expensive for Lyft to expand in places like rural Wisconsin, where his 80-year-old father lives. His elderly father is unable to drive like he once was able to, which has caused his parents to see their friends as often as they once did.If autonomous car technology becomes safe enough, however, Lyft could afford to debut its ride-sharing service in places like where his father lives, Sheikh believes. By that time, Lyft may have a ride-sharing service that people subscribe to, similar to Netflix, Sheikh explained.","Artificial intelligence technologies aren‰Ûªt just being used to help computers more quickly recognize dogs in photos.Insurance Companies Want to Speed Up Claims Processing Using DronesDuring the past few years, insurance companies like Allstate have been using drones to inspect homes for storm damage.Following hurricanes Harvey and Irma last year, Kespry helped insurance companies that he did not name take aerial photos of damaged home rooftops.As more devices are connected online, Birr says that electrical grids will need artificial intelligence technologies to more efficiently distribute power.One Reason Lyft Is Testing Self-Driving CarsOne reason ride-hailing company Lyft is testing self-driving cars is to help the company expand into more rural areas.","['insurance', 'energy', 'artificial', 'companies', 'drone', 'technologies', 'intelligence', 'company', 'experimenting', 'using', 'mastercard', 'lyft']",,,['Jonathan Vanian'],4/12/18 0:00,http://fortune.com/2018/04/12/lyft-mastercard-drone-artificial-intelligence/,,,,
Mastercard's revenue boosted by spending rise,"By AnnaMaria Andriotis and Imani MoiseMastercard Inc. reported higher-than-expected profit and revenue for the first quarter due to increased consumer spending and confidence.The company, which is the second-largest U.S. card network, increased guidance for its 2018 revenue, a sign that it believes the healthy economic environment will continue. It also increased a key expense growth projection as the company accelerates investments in several areas, including security.Mastercard reported a profit of $1.49 billion, or $1.41 a share, up from $1.08 billion, or $1 a share, a year earlier. On an adjusted basis, earnings rose 49% to $1.50 a share from a year earlier. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters had expected $1.25.Shares climbed 3.5% to $186.80 in morning trading, higher than the record closing price of $183.24 set in March. The stock has gained 22.5% so far this year while the S&P 500 has inched 0.8% lower.Gross dollar volume, or the total value of all transactions on credit, debit and prepaid cards processed by the company, rose 14% to $1.4 trillion.The payment giant said revenue jumped 31% to $3.58 billion, topping the $3.25 billion forecast by analysts. The company's top-line was helped by acquisitions and an increase in cardholders using their cards outside of the country they are issued in. Cross-border volume fee revenue increased 26% from a year prior. The company also increased its organic net revenue growth guidance to mid-teens percent growth for the year, up slightly from the previous guidance.The company is benefiting from a strong credit-card market as consumers shift more of their spending to cards. Most large U.S. banks that issue credit cards reported sizable increases in credit-card purchase volume in the first quarter.Mastercard's finance chief, Martina Hund-Mejean, said on the earnings call that cross-border volumes in April, through April 28, grew 19% globally. That was down from the 21% cross-border volume growth in the first quarter, in part due to the drop-off of issuers allowing cryptocurrency wallet funding. Large U.S. issuers, including Citigroup Inc, Bank of America Corp., and Capital One Financial Corp., said during the first quarter that they would no longer allow consumers to buy bitcoin with their credit cards.Mastercard's operating expenses totaled $1.64 billion, up 35% from a year prior, excluding special items relating to litigation provisions. General and administrative expenses, which make up the majority of the company's expenses, increased 36%. Advertising and marketing expenses rose 32% to $224 million. Mastercard also increased its organic expense growth guidance to high-single digit percent growth from mid-single digits previously.Regarding its efforts to expand in China, Mastercard CEO Ajay Banga said the company applied for a domestic license with a joint venture and that it is waiting for clarity from the Chinese government. The Wall Street Journal reported in April that Mastercard had formed a partnership with three Chinese entities, had applied with the central bank to conduct card-clearing and settlement transactions in the country, and that its joint-venture application hadn't yet been accepted by the People's Bank of China.Separately, Mr. Banga discussed his support for a move to a single-pay button at online checkout. Visa and Mastercard said in April they are planning a move toward a shared pay button on which consumers can save their payment credentials. This would replace the individual pay buttons that card networks have rolled out in recent years.Write to AnnaMaria Andriotis at annamaria.andriotis@wsj.com and Imani Moise at imani.moise@wsj.com","By AnnaMaria Andriotis and Imani MoiseMastercard Inc. reported higher-than-expected profit and revenue for the first quarter due to increased consumer spending and confidence.Mastercard reported a profit of $1.49 billion, or $1.41 a share, up from $1.08 billion, or $1 a share, a year earlier.Cross-border volume fee revenue increased 26% from a year prior.The company also increased its organic net revenue growth guidance to mid-teens percent growth for the year, up slightly from the previous guidance.General and administrative expenses, which make up the majority of the company's expenses, increased 36%.","['boosted', 'spending', 'rise', 'billion', 'company', 'cards', 'mastercards', 'reported', 'growth', 'increased', 'volume', 'revenue', 'mastercard', 'expenses']",,,[],5/2/18 0:00,https://www.marketwatch.com/story/mastercards-revenue-boosted-by-spending-rise-2018-05-02-114853827,,,,

Why Mastercard (MA) Could Be an Impressive Growth Stock,"Growth stocks can be some of the most exciting picks in the market, as these high-flyers can captivate investors' attention, and produce big gains as well.

Why MasterCard sees itself as a technology company first,"During a WHOSAY event at the ANA Masters of Marketing in Orlando, Florida, Rajamannar elaborated on that with Erin Andrews, the world‰Ûªs most famous female sportscaster. Digital is at the heart of everything MasterCard does because he‰Ûªs aware that the world is continuously moving in that direction. And with that in mind, he declares storytelling, a core tenet of advertising, to be ‰ÛÏon its deathbed.‰Ûù‰ÛÏI think the advertising model is obsolete,‰Ûù he says. ‰ÛÏFor me, the way to reach consumers and engage them is through experiences. When consumers have experiences, they talk about them on their social channels and their friends listen,‰Ûù he explains. ‰ÛÏIt‰Ûªs hugely beneficial for us to engage consumers and make them our brand ambassadors. That‰Ûªs what we call ‰Û÷storymaking,‰Ûª which the future is all about.‰ÛùPriceless experiencesLook at Netflix. People collectively watch 1 billion(!) hours of video content each week, all without ads. Rajamannar interprets that as the consumer saying loudly and clearly, ‰Û÷I don‰Ûªt want your stupid ads! I care about my experience!‰Ûª‰ÛùAnd MasterCard is all about experiences. It‰Ûªs the centerpiece of the 20-year-old ‰ÛÏPriceless‰Ûù campaign, which has since evolved to include an entire website that works as an experience engine. Consumers can book a private tour of the Chichen Itza pyramids in Mexico or a candlelit trip to the Louvre after hours, among others.And that‰Ûªs just one way MasterCard is bridging the gap between physical and digital, while some other financial services brands are only just becoming customer-centric.Virtual shoppingEvery year, MasterCard sponsors the Arnold Palmer Invitational golf tournament in Orlando, Florida. In 2016, the brand debuted a virtual reality experience that involved a tour of the 17th hole with Northern Irish golf legend Graeme McDowell. The twist: It was shoppable.‰ÛÏIf you focused on Graeme‰Ûªs shirt for more than two seconds, something popped up that tells you the brand, price, materials, colors, whatever,‰Ûù says Rajamannar. ‰ÛÏYou can make choices about each of those by looking at them and pay right there in the experience. That‰Ûªs clinching the deal during the moment of truth.‰ÛùThe VR commerce wasn‰Ûªt just a one-time stunt. In September, MasterCard launched a similar experience with Swarovski chandeliers. Rajamannar points out that it benefits the brand immensely, eliminating the need for inventory that‰Ûªs as large as it is fragile.The moment of truthIt ultimately comes down to the conversion of digital and physical Rajamannar thinks represents the industry‰Ûªs future.‰ÛÏIf you see the statistics, 7% of the households in the U.S. already have either a Google Home or an Alexa,‰Ûù he says. ‰ÛÏHow many times are you going to make your purchase simply by telling the device, which is a smart speaker at the end of the day, what to buy? As a marketer, how do I get into that stream and impact consumers‰Ûª choice at the moment of truth? That‰Ûªs what we‰Ûªre so excited about.‰ÛùAlso recently, MasterCard created a real-time marketing engine that engages consumers on social media. It tries to affect their perception or influence their behavior in favor of MasterCard. From there, the brand does what it always does: Helps create experiences.","Digital is at the heart of everything MasterCard does because he‰Ûªs aware that the world is continuously moving in that direction.When consumers have experiences, they talk about them on their social channels and their friends listen,‰Ûù he explains.And that‰Ûªs just one way MasterCard is bridging the gap between physical and digital, while some other financial services brands are only just becoming customer-centric.That‰Ûªs what we‰Ûªre so excited about.‰ÛùAlso recently, MasterCard created a real-time marketing engine that engages consumers on social media.From there, the brand does what it always does: Helps create experiences.","['does', 'sees', 'digital', 'rajamannar', 'technology', 'moment', 'thats', 'brand', 'experiences', 'company', 'experience', 'consumers', 'mastercard']",,,"['Date Published', ""Mike O'Brien"", 'Tereza Litsa']",2018-01-29 13:45:51+01:00,https://www.clickz.com/mastercard-tech-company-first/209799/,,,,

The change is designed to allow for a more consistent, streamlined, and speedy checkout experience for both merchants and cardholders.Credit and debit card companies have long required signatures for purchases as an added security measure, but with technology improvements that include contactless payments and the adoption of EMV chip technology, signatures are no longer a necessity.American Express has already phased out signature requirements for purchases under $50 in the United States, as have other credit card companies, and the complete elimination of the signature is a shift that consumers are likely to welcome.Doing away with signature requirements for credit and debit card transactions will also streamline the Apple Pay process in the United States when using a Mastercard, Discover, or American Express card. With Apple Pay, a signature can on occasion be required for purchases over $50 in the United States, a step that may be eliminated once the card changes are introduced.Apple Pay customers in other countries that have similar restrictions may also see them lifted when using American Express, but there are locations like Canada where contactless payments are not permitted for large purchases. In these situations, there will be no improvements to the Apple Pay process.While Mastercard and Discover have said the change applies to the United States and Canada, American Express plans to eliminate signature requirements globally on purchase transactions of all amounts. Merchants are, however, still able to collect signatures if required to do so by an applicable law in a particular jurisdiction.","""The payments landscape has evolved to the point where we can now eliminate this pain point for our merchants,"" said Jaromir Divilek, Executive Vice President, Global Network Business, American Express.In addition, the majority of American Express transactions today already do not require a signature at the point of sale as a result of previous policy changes we made to help our merchants.""American Express today announced plans to eliminate signature requirements when customers make credit or debit card purchases, joining both Mastercard and Discover All three companies plan to stop asking customers to provide a signature when making a purchase in the United States and Canada starting in April of 2018.In these situations, there will be no improvements to the Apple Pay process.While Mastercard and Discover have said the change applies to the United States and Canada, American Express plans to eliminate signature requirements globally on purchase transactions of all amounts.Merchants are, however, still able to collect signatures if required to do so by an applicable law in a particular jurisdiction.","['card', 'requirement', 'express', 'signature', 'discover', 'american', '2018', 'united', 'requirements', 'pay', 'eliminate', 'purchases', 'states', 'signatures', 'mastercard']",,,"['Juli Clover', 'Monday December', 'Am Pst', 'Hours Ago On', 'Days Ago On']",12/11/17 0:00,https://www.macrumors.com/2017/12/11/amex-mastercard-discover-no-signature-2018/,,,,

Modern Finance Chain Launches Service To Rival Visa/Mastercard Payments,"The digital currency industry seems to be taking on the mainstream financial system head-on. Modern Finance Chain has developed a new system meant to fill the gap between crypto users and merchant establishments like Visa Inc (NYSE:V) and Mastercard Inc (NYSE:MA).MF Chain offers a solution meant to solve several problems in the commerce industry. The company‰Ûªs services are meant to leverage merchant payment integration so as to unite merchants and users.Former CEO Of Visa UK To Head Crypto StartupChina‰Ûªs IFCERT Tracks Down 421 Fake Cryptocurrencies; 60% Run By Overseas ServersBridging the payment systemThe world digital currency sector is working to have cryptocurrencies fully accepted as a system of payment. To fully achieve this status, necessary infrastructure must be put in place to ensure that it is self-reliant and does not have to entirely depend on the mainstream financial system. MF Chain is facilitating the adoption of digital currencies as well as their use as a payment system by integrating several blockchain technologies using multi-currency ICO platforms.Having full control of the transactionsAccording to Vic Shybaiev from Modern Finance Chain, credit card companies like Visa and MasterCard take over the whole transaction. The merchant has no control or say over the transaction. It is the credit card company that solely determines if the merchant will receive the money, the fees charged on the transaction as well as the time it will take to execute the transaction.MF Chain says that over the years, the digital currency industry has shown tremendous growth and many digital currency investors have accumulated a lot of wealth. However, despite this massive growth, the sector remains largely inconvenient in terms of using cryptocurrencies to pay for goods and services. The sector largely depends of third party companies to process transactions.Many blockchain projects are isolated and engaged in innovations that fall within their own communities and technologies. MF Chain is determined to get rid of the barriers that affect the change of cryprocurencies to cash and vice versa. This, by extension is aimed at creating a self-reliant digital economy which is able to accommodate any new innovations.The new system has been designed in such a way that it does not confine users to a certain wallet and instead integrates cryptocurrency wallets via API. This innovative feature offers merchants with the freedom and power to choose who and where to send the digital currencies.Bitcoin (BTC-USD) is trading at $8330.28 down $89.37 (1.0614%) with about $471MM trading hands in the last 24 hours.

I would suggest a close below $135 as a new risk point.""Looking over our updated charts this morning, we can see a late November/early December pullback that stopped short of our stop loss point below $135. From the early December low, prices have soared another $25. A fresh look at MA seems in order.Mastercard is one of the financial stocks that Jim Cramer mentions in his article about the three sectors that are driving up the markets, published Monday morning.In this daily bar chart of MA, below, we can see that the price of MA is above the rising 50-day moving average line and the rising 200-day line. The daily On-Balance-Volume (OBV) line is still strong and rising -- just as it was back in October. The trend-following Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) oscillator is in a strong uptrend.In this weekly bar chart of MA, below, we can see that prices are above the rising 40-week moving average line. The weekly OBV line has been edging higher since July 2016 and is still bullish. The MACD oscillator just crossed back to an uptrend and a new outright go long signal.In this Point and Figure chart of MA, below, we can see a consolidation pattern from October (look for the ""A"" on the chart). A tentative price target of $219 is shown.Bottom line: MA has made a big move up the past year, but sell signals are not present. Prices are on the stretched side, so I would be on alert for a possible sideways correction.

Key Takeaways From MasterCard's Q3,"In continuation with an impressive performance over the first half of the year, MasterCard (NYSE: MA) posted a strong Q3 on Tuesday, October 31. The company reported EPS growth of 24% on revenue growth of 18%. The company‰Ûªs core performance continues to be strong, in line with our expectations. The company posted strong growth across all divisions, with transaction processing fees in the U.S. growing at 22% for the quarter. The only downside for the company was that client incentives and rebates grew faster than overall revenue growth at 20%. These trends are similar to what we witnessed in the previous quarters and in line with our expectations for the company.The company‰Ûªs expenses grew at the same pace as revenues, meaning that the company‰Ûªs operating margin stayed just about flat. Going forward, we expect MasterCard‰Ûªs expenditures on sales and marketing, and client incentives to grow slower, especially as it integrates the capabilities of NuData Security into its software suite. Credit card customers are increasingly preferring security and ease of use over reward points, and the company‰Ûªs focus in this direction can have a significant impact on the bottom line, as well as helping to grow its transaction volumes both in the U.S. and internationally. In this quarter, Gross dollar volume of processed transactions grew at 10% in the U.S. Cross border volumes grew at 15% on a local currency basis.Going forward, MasterCard continues to be focused on expanding its network of co-branding partners and improving technology to compete in the rapidly growing online payments business segment. Recent deals with Paypal, Bank of America, Santander and Banque Travelex among others, should help the company on the first front. Thus, we expect the company to continue growing at a strong rate going forward.We currently have a price estimate of $109 for MasterCard, which is significantly below the current market price.Interactive Institutional Research (Powered by Trefis):Global Large Cap | U.S. Mid & Small Cap | European Large & Mid Cap |More Trefis ResearchLike our charts?

John Archer‰Ûªs TAB Fund holds positions in VISA (V), MasterCard (MA) and PayPal (PYPL) that total 17% of his portfolio. Shares in these three companies have advanced roughly 42%, 45% and 84% respectively this year helping push John‰Ûªs TAB fund up over 23% to beat the S&P 500 by over 7 points year-to-date.Ken Kam: What‰Ûªs happening in the payments systems business? Why are these companies doing so well?John Archer: Forms of electronic payment are growing quickly on a global scale. Convenience and safety are driving acceptance with both retailers and consumers. There is a long-term transition in progress across the globe from primarily cash-based payments to credit cards, debit cards and other forms of electronic payments. This is a trend that will continue for decades to come, so the continued growth and long-term success of the large established payment networks is almost assured.VISA and MasterCard are so dominant that it will be extremely difficult for others to effectively compete with them. According to the Nilson Report approximately 50% of all credit card transactions and 75% of all debit card transactions flow through VISA‰Ûªs network.They also estimate that MasterCard has a market share of about 25%. Both companies have significant brand awareness that has been built up over decades and their economies of scale are greater than other participants. Their size and profitability allow them to make investments in new technology to keep ahead of competitors and offer the latest advances in security, mobile payments, payment data and other services.Kam: The payments business is changing rapidly and there are large companies like Google and Apple entering the market. How will these new competitors affect the established companies?Archer: Technology companies like Google and Apple have millions of customers that could potentially use Android Pay or Apple Pay on their mobile devices but payments still flow through the established payment networks for settlement.Tech companies offer payment services as an added ancillary benefit for their customers so financial payments are not a core focus for them. They realize that the networks of the primary providers like VISA and MasterCard are so dominant that it would be almost impossible to unseat the incumbents.Kam: What are the risks in investing in these businesses?Archer: There are abundant risks inherent in any common stock investment but the primary risks of investing in dominant payment systems companies would be regulatory, legal and financial.The business is an oligopoly with only a handful of competitors, so regulatory authorities in the U.S., Europe and Australia have tried various measures to limit their dominance and encourage competition.VISA purchased 100% of VISA Europe in 2016 making its competitive position even stronger there. The size of the acquisition was over $18 billion. There is always some risk of integrating an acquisition of that size but management has indicated that so far, integration is proceeding smoothly.There has been several law suits filed over the years against the payment network companies by merchants that believe they are paying fees that are too high. This litigation is ongoing, but doesn‰Ûªt appear to be a significant threat at this time. Moreover, merchants are demanding more incentives from the payment networks and these have been growing over the years. In spite of these discounts, the volume and value of payments has been increasing, offsetting the incentives paid to the merchants.Kam: VISA and MasterCard in particular seem expensive, and with most markets at all-time highs, why invest in these companies now?Archer: You are absolutely right! I have painfully realized over the years that excellent companies rarely trade at a discount to the market or too much less than their intrinsic values based on a discounted free cash flow analysis.I have missed investing in wonderful businesses because I thought they were too expensive. Companies like VISA and MasterCard that are growing revenue and earnings at double digit rates are indeed somewhat rare today. These are companies with dominant market share positions and business models. They are among the most profitable companies in business today with operating margins exceeding 50% and net income margins approaching 40%! These companies are well positioned for continued growth over the long-term. Buy them and participate in their continued growth and success over the years.My Take: After a strong performance in 2015, followed by a disappointing performance in 2016, John Archer reevaluated every stock in his TAB portfolio to make sure he had his capital in his best ideas. The happy result is that John has bounced back with a market-beating performance year-to-date in 2017. These performance fluctuations are not uncommon among investment managers. It underscores the importance of focusing on long-term investment performance and keeping emotions in check.John started his Marketocracy portfolio in September of 2013. In 2015, his TAB portfolio returned 7.60% which compares favorably to the S&P 500‰Ûªs return of 1.38%. In 2016, he was down 7.58% while the S&P 500 was up 11.96%. After reevaluating his portfolio at the end of 2016, he is ahead of the S&P 500 in 2017, 23.37% to 16.91%. Before taking anyone‰Ûªs investment advice, you should always check out their track record. Here‰Ûªs John‰Ûªs.John's TAB fund is not a mutual fund. It is an investment option for clients of our separately managed account program.

Mastercard CFO: Lack of Crypto Wallet Funding Is Partly Why Cross-Border Transaction Growth Is In Decline,"Quarterly cross-border transaction growth for Mastercard declined by 2% over the last year partly due to the lack of customers using the service to purchase cryptocurrencies, according to Mastercard‰Ûªs CFO.During the May earnings call, Mastercard‰Ûªs CFO Martina Hund-Mejean revealed that quarterly cross-border transaction growth for the company is down by 2% from the first quarter.Hund-Mejean has attributed this lack of cross-border payment growth to drop in crypto-wallet funding. The Mastercard CFO highlighted the role of cryptocurrencies in the growth slowdown in a recent earnings call:‰ÛÏThis is due to the recent drop-off in crypto wallet funding. We expect cross-border growth to moderate somewhat.‰ÛùA number of banks across America, including JP Morgan and Bank of America, have recently moved to ban credit card transactions to cryptocurrencies. This ban has, in turn, caused a domino effect with smaller banks like Capital One and Citigroup following their lead, potentially contributing to the decline in crypto wallet funding transactions.Mastercard Stock Maintains Steady ClimbDespite this slight dip in growth, Mastercard stock continues to climb with a 3% gain after the reported profits beat Wall Street expectations with price trading at $186.48.While the short-term effect caused by the lack of crypto purchasing through the platform has marginally decreased cross-border transaction growth, cryptocurrency based card vendors are primed to assist the payment platform in establishing a strong presence in the cryptocurrency sector ‰ÛÓ should Mastercard choose to support it.While such integration would provide greater usability for cryptocurrencies in allowing users to transact with any preexisting merchants, Mastercard appears to have no interest in taking part in this level of the financial sector.During the earnings call Mastercard CEO Ajay Banga illustrated his concerns about the erratic nature of the crypto market stating:‰ÛÏThis is not something we count on because we just don‰Ûªt know how to predict it or we don‰Ûªt even want to count it.‰ÛùMastercard cryptocurrency debit cards are not a new concept ‰ÛÓ companies such as Wirex, CoinsBank and Wagecan current support Mastercard transactions with varying fee structures. However, this segment of cryptocurrency market has been anything but stable.Shifting Policy Causes Investors to Seek Other ChannelsThis unexpected turn of events has eroded the market‰Ûªs trust in such platforms toprovide reliable and consistent service until further financial frameworks are established.Additionally, the recent growth of Bitcoin-enabled ATMs and point of sales have brought into question the place of such systems within the economic framework, as most charge excess fees to access the Mastercard network.As cryptocurrencies continue to grow, consumer gateways will continue to be an invaluable asset to enable investors to conduct daily transactions with fiat merchants.Whether this occurs through widespread adoption of crypto-powered point of sale systems or the implementation of crypto-enabled payment gateways such as Mastercard depends heavily on whether these financial services decide to embrace cryptocurrencies moving forward.Cover Photo by Mike Kononov on UnsplashDisclaimer: Our writers' opinions are solely their own and do not reflect the opinion of CryptoSlate.

Mastercard to Implement Biometrics for In-Store Card Payments,"Mastercard is implementing biometrics for card payments, with plans to go live by April 2019.The financial giant said that all consumers will be able to identify themselves with biometrics such as fingerprints or facial recognition whenever they pay in stores with Mastercard. Biometric options will also be implemented for all contactless transactions made at terminals with a mobile device.In practice, that means that banks issuing Mastercard-branded cards will have to be able to offer biometric authentication for remote transactions, alongside existing PIN and password verification.The increased availability of biometric capabilities on tablets and smartphones ‰ÛÒ like Apple‰Ûªs FaceID ‰ÛÒ and the EU‰Ûªs new regulatory requirements for strong authentication are driving Mastercard‰Ûªs move, the company said.‰ÛÏBiometric technologies perfectly meet the public‰Ûªs expectation for state-of-the-art security when making a payment,‰Ûù said Mark Barnett, president, Mastercard UK & Ireland. ‰ÛÏThis will be of great benefit to everyone: consumers, retailers and banks. It will make the purchase much smoother, and instead of having to remember passwords to authenticate, shoppers will have the chance to use a fingerprint or a picture of themselves.‰ÛùThe vast majority of consumers ‰ÛÒ 93% ‰ÛÒprefer biometrics over passwords for validating payments, according to a research paper conducted by Oxford University in collaboration with Mastercard. It also found that 92% of banking professionals want to adopt biometric solutions.Banks also report that when such biometric authentication is used, customers are much more inclined to go through with their purchase. The abandonment rates can drop by up to 70% compared to other methods, like two-factor authentication with codes sent via SMS.Existing methods to prove an identity online can also take shoppers away from a retailer‰Ûªs website if they‰Ûªre too time consuming or complex. One way to solve that is moving from a reliance on what the consumer knows (e.g., passwords) and what they have (card or smart device) to what they have (e.g. ,mobile phone) and who they are (their biometrics).Mastercard is not new to the biometrics game. Mastercard Identity Check, now available in 37 countries around the world, is an authentication solution that enables individuals to use biometric identifiers, such as fingerprint, iris and facial recognition, to verify their identity using a mobile device during online shopping and banking activities. Better known as ""pay-by-selfie"" across Europe, its goal is improved friction-free authentication for users.","Mastercard is implementing biometrics for card payments, with plans to go live by April 2019.The financial giant said that all consumers will be able to identify themselves with biometrics such as fingerprints or facial recognition whenever they pay in stores with Mastercard.In practice, that means that banks issuing Mastercard-branded cards will have to be able to offer biometric authentication for remote transactions, alongside existing PIN and password verification.‰ÛÏBiometric technologies perfectly meet the public‰Ûªs expectation for state-of-the-art security when making a payment,‰Ûù said Mark Barnett, president, Mastercard UK & Ireland.Banks also report that when such biometric authentication is used, customers are much more inclined to go through with their purchase.","['instore', 'biometric', 'shoppers', 'mastercard', 'authentication', 'identity', 'payments', 'transactions', 'implement', 'mobile', 'biometrics', 'consumers', 'card', 'passwords']",,,['Tara Seals'],1/25/18 18:36,https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/mastercard-to-implement-biometrics/,,,,
"SAP Adds Mastercard, Postmates to Connected Car Network","BARCELONA‰ÛÓHow do you know connected cars are actually smart? One piece of the puzzle is making sure they can talk to all the other connected vehicles, devices, and establishments around them.The SAP Vehicles Network has been around since 2015 doing just that. Built on the SAP Cloud Platform and part of the SAP Leonardo IoT portfolio, the B2B network is designed to connect participating companies. This occurs through automated data exchanges and transactions for services such as food, gas, navigation, parking, and digital payments.The network and open marketplace includes car manufacturers like BMW, Toyota, and Volkswagen, fuel companies such as Shell, car rental companies like Hertz, parking companies around the globe, and a slew of other tech, payments, and services providers. This year at Mobile World Congress, SAP announced three new partners in the vehicles network: Mastercard, Here, and Postmates.""We'll be working with Mastercard specifically leveraging tokenization services to secure payments,"" said Heino Kantimm, SAP's Chief Connected Vehicles Expert. ""Then on the other side we can tap into the Mastercard merchant network and merchant inventory on the supply side. We're building out a network of networks.""Kantimm explained that the Here partnership adds holistic traffic navigation and mapping to the network. The mapping data will integrated with searchable points of interest from other companies in the marketplace, be it parking lots or gas stations.Then there's Postmates, which has already been dabbling in the autonomous car market. The courier app falls more on the supply side of the marketplace, bringing in a network of food retailers and delivery services.Another example Kantimm gave of how the network can function is with SAP's own expense tracking app, Concur.""People are driving around on either private or busines trips. If it's professional, then parking, fuel, food services...you ideally want a way to conveniently expense that, which is where Concur comes to the table,"" said Kantimm. ""Imagine you purchase gas for your car on a business trip. So because the network works with Concur, the car will make sure the expense is automatically pushed through with an integration into the app.""While there are several car manufacturers in the network, Kantimm said he doesn't see automotive companies as the only target market. The telco companies building network infrastructure to keep cars connected and the payment providers enabling contactless transactions; they're all part of what is ultimately envisioned as an automated fabric for self-driving cars that consumers won't even need to notice.","One piece of the puzzle is making sure they can talk to all the other connected vehicles, devices, and establishments around them.The SAP Vehicles Network has been around since 2015 doing just that.This year at Mobile World Congress, SAP announced three new partners in the vehicles network: Mastercard, Here, and Postmates.""We'll be working with Mastercard specifically leveraging tokenization services to secure payments,"" said Heino Kantimm, SAP's Chief Connected Vehicles Expert.While there are several car manufacturers in the network, Kantimm said he doesn't see automotive companies as the only target market.","['vehicles', 'sap', 'connected', 'postmates', 'companies', 'kantimm', 'services', 'parking', 'network', 'car', 'mastercard', 'adds']",,,"['About The Author', ""Rob Marvin Is Pcmag'S Associate Features Editor.

"In Launch Of 'Start Something Priceless,' Mastercard Works To Further Brand's Cultural Relevance","MastercardToday Mastercard unveils the evolution of its two decades-old ‰ÛÏPriceless‰Ûù brand platform: ‰ÛÏStart Something Priceless.‰Ûù It‰Ûªs a move that acknowledges societal changes and the reality that today‰Ûªs increasingly younger consumers want to both work for and engage with brands and businesses with a distinguishable core purpose, companies that stand for more than just making money.It's also part of Chief Marketing and Communications Officer Raja Rajamannar's goal to move the company's brand from storytelling and story-making to ""story-inspiring,"" he said. ‰ÛÏWe wanted to advance ‰Û÷Priceless‰Ûª from being a big ad platform, from observing priceless moments in people‰Ûªs lives, to actually enabling them,‰Ûù he said. It‰Ûªs a call for people to ‰ÛÏwake up and do something good, and, who knows‰ÛÓmaybe start a global movement,‰Ûù he said. ‰ÛÏMoments can become movements.‰ÛùThe ‰ÛÏPriceless‰Ûù platform has, for more than 20 years, worked ‰ÛÏvery well around the world‰Ûù for the brand, Rajamannar said. But when it launched in 1997, ‰ÛÏthe world was very different‰ÛÓno internet, no social media.‰Ûù And just in the past four years, since when Rajamannar joined as CMO, ‰ÛÏthe world has changed,‰Ûù he said. There have been cultural changes, he said, referring to a study that found that 89% of people believe that brands have the power to make a change in society. ‰ÛÏBrands should stand for what they believe; Millennials demand that brands do good,‰Ûù he said.‰ÛÏStart Something Priceless,‰Ûù with multimedia work by longtime creative agency McCann, takes the ‰ÛÏPriceless‰Ûù concept‰ÛÓthat Mastercard makes priceless experiences possible‰ÛÓa big step further as a call to action, urging people to pledge to pursue their passions, help others and create cultural change‰ÛÓeven with small acts.MastercardIt aligns with Mastercard‰Ûªs commitment to making a difference in communities around the globe, for example, through programs such as the World Food Programme and Stand Up to Cancer. And it started with rallying its own troops to do good with small acts. In fact, the company recently extended the number of volunteer days for its employees, Rajamannar said, adding that ‰ÛÏemployee satisfaction is through the roof.‰ÛùThe new ‰ÛÏPriceless‰Ûù positioning, which invites consumers to share their pledge to give back and effect change with @Mastercard via #StartSomethingPriceless, will integrate into all Mastercard sponsorships, such as the Grammy Awards, Brit Awards, UEFA Champions League, Rugby World Cup, Australian Open, Cannes Film Festival, and the Arnold Palmer Invitational.It comes at a time when many big brands are working to put purpose at the core of everything they do to drive growth. Getting it right requires striking a delicate balance and being as transparent and authentic as possible. ‰ÛÏMarketing used to be all about brand, but we needed it to be about three pillars: brand, business and sustainable platforms that give you a competitive edge for the company,‰Ûù Rajamannar said.MastercardTo be sure, the effort isn‰Ûªt just altruistic; it is meant to further build business for the already financially well-performing company, he said, explaining how involvement with groups such as the World Food Programme, Stand Up to Cancer and the Red Cross create opportunities Mastercard to partner with banks, merchants and governments.It echoes the perspective of Antonio Lucio, chief marketing and communications officer at HP Inc., who recently explained to Forbes that ‰ÛÏemotional connection is everything. In this noisy world, brands must elevate above the clutter through meaningful connections. Great brands surprise us, inspire us, make us feel, and motivate us to act.‰ÛùThe evolved platform also aligns with Rajamannar‰Ûªs own efforts as an influential marketing executive at a time when CMOs increasingly are stepping out as the faces of their companies and as individuals to drive industry and cultural change. One example is the recent effort on the part of a group of CMOs to expand programming at this year's Consumer Electronics Show that showcases women leaders. Last year named one of Forbes‰Ûª World‰Ûªs Most Influential CMOs, Rajamannar, involved in many industry organizations including the Association of National Advertisers and PTTOW!, particularly pushing for his peers to help attract and nurture the next generation of marketing talent, explained that the new ‰ÛÏPriceless‰Ûù positioning is ‰ÛÏa great confluence of brand strategy, company purpose and my personal passion.‰ÛùThis week the effort kicks off by teasing creative work that showcases individuals who have persevered through adversity, such as bias or physical limitations, to rise to supeMastercardIn addition, Mastercard is teasing the next phase of work, this time featuring 22 amateur soccer players from many different countries who shun bias toward each other and come together to play a match.Building out the effort will be experiential marketing, including interactive billboards through which passersby in Paris can donate school meals via contactless payment technology.‰ÛÏWhen you infuse social good into the core of business practices, that grows your brand, drives business and gives you a competitive advantage,‰Ûù Rajamannar said.","‰ÛÏWe wanted to advance ‰Û÷Priceless‰Ûª from being a big ad platform, from observing priceless moments in people‰Ûªs lives, to actually enabling them,‰Ûù he said.‰ÛÏMoments can become movements.‰ÛùThe ‰ÛÏPriceless‰Ûù platform has, for more than 20 years, worked ‰ÛÏvery well around the world‰Ûù for the brand, Rajamannar said.‰ÛÏBrands should stand for what they believe; Millennials demand that brands do good,‰Ûù he said.‰ÛÏStart Something Priceless,‰Ûù with multimedia work by longtime creative agency McCann, takes the ‰ÛÏPriceless‰Ûù concept‰ÛÓthat Mastercard makes priceless experiences possible‰ÛÓa big step further as a call to action, urging people to pledge to pursue their passions, help others and create cultural change‰ÛÓeven with small acts.In this noisy world, brands must elevate above the clutter through meaningful connections.","['launch', 'marketing', 'works', 'stand', 'cultural', 'rajamannar', 'world', 'relevance', 'brand', 'work', 'start', 'brands', 'priceless', 'mastercard', 'platform']",,,['Jennifer Rooney'],1/18/18 0:00,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jenniferrooney/2018/01/18/in-launch-of-start-something-priceless-mastercard-works-to-further-brands-cultural-relevance/,,,,
Mastercard reports Q1 earnings May 2,"What's HappeningCredit card company Mastercard ( MA ) will report its first-quarter numbers May 2. The company will report before the market open, with the consensus calling for earnings of $1.26 per share, up from $1.01 during the same period last year. MA shares have risen 16.3% on the year.Technical AnalysisMA was recently trading at $176.71, down $7.02 from its 12-month high and $61.16 above its 12-month low. Overall technical indicators for MA are bullish with a strong upward trend. The stock has recent support above $170.50, and recent resistance below $179.50. Of the 28 analysts who cover the stock, 23 rate it a ""strong buy"", two rate it a ""buy"", and three rate it a ""hold"". MA gets a score of 90 from InvestorsObserver's Stock Score Report.Analyst's ThoughtsA strong underlying economy with low unemployment is a great landscape for credit card companies such as Mastercard. Consumer confidence is high, and consumer spending has been good. Not only are consumers buying, they are using credit cards more than ever. Total credit card debt hit a record level in 2017 at $1 trillion, with the average American's credit card balance rising 3% in 2017 to $6,375. All of the major credit card companies have been strong, and the outlook remains bright for the sector. Analysts see strong year over year growth for the most recent quarter, and taking a long term view, analysts forecast Mastercard will grow its profits by 20.7% per annum over the next five years. The street is bullish on the stock, and have a whisper number of $1.29 versus the consensus $1.26, so the market definitely expects an earnings beat, which should push shares higher.

Betalingsgiganten MasterCard presenterte norsk teknologi,"Det norske firmaet IDEX har samarbeidet med gigantfirmaet MasterCard om kredittkort med avlesing av fingeravtrykk. Produktet blir tilgjengelig i lÌüpet av Ì´ret.‰ÛÒ For oss er dette banebrytende, sier Charlotte Knudsen, kommunikasjonssjef for IDEX, til NTB i etterkant av Mastercards pressemelding tirsdag.Knudsen forklarer at hennes firma har samarbeidet med MasterCard om utvikling av biometriske kort, kredittkort med fingeravtrykk, siden 2015. LÌüsningen presentert tirsdag gjÌür det mulig for brukeren Ì´ selv kunne registrere sitt fingeravtrykk i kortet, noe som kan erstatte dagens bruk av pinkode.Brukere registrerer fingeravtrykket sitt pÌ´ kredittkortet ved hjelp av en skanner som bestÌ´r av en slags plastlomme med et lite batteri som sendes i posten.

Consumers‰Ûª ‰Û÷Contextual Loyalty‰Ûª Defined in Mastercard‰Ûªs Rewards Study,"Good things come in threes. Financial services firm Mastercard recently released its 2018 Rewards Panel Consumer Survey and unveiled data that points to a trifecta of ‰ÛÏcontextual loyalty:"" personalization, digital experience and instant gratification.The survey culled consumer data from 5,000 rewards credit card holders across a range of networks and issuers in the U.S., with respondents identified via three distinct categories: Redeemers, those who redeem points from their loyalty programs; Non-redeemers, consumers that are not aware of or taking advantage of credit card loyalty programs; and Under-redeemers, those that are aware of loyalty program options, but are not utilizing any rewards or services, or simply do not know how to redeem.And the study suggests that for today‰Ûªs shopper, loyalty is contingent upon control coupled with flexibility, the firm said, which is the guiding principle for its ‰ÛÏPay With Rewards‰Ûù program that is grounded in these findings. The program‰Ûªs accompanying slogan, ‰ÛÏIt‰Ûªs your points, your way,‰Ûù is modeled after the modern-day consumer, as it reflects shoppers‰Ûª desire for frictionless and meaningful spending. Pay with Rewards allows shoppers to select and redeem rewards at the point-of-sale through its app, enabling greater and more strategic use of consumers' earned loyalty points.Jamie Samaha, senior vice president of global products and services at Mastercard, told WWD, ""In our space, what we're seeing is that if you can get these things right, you're going to see a more engaged consumer, a consumer who is willing to give you their business and a consumer you're going to have a more intimate, loyal relationship with."" He added, ""Often when people think about loyalty, they think the value is the points that you get. And that's certainly an important part, but I think at Mastercard what we're thinking about is a much broader spectrum when we bring our loyalty services together."" This spectrum is inclusive of customized benefits or access; the use of internal data to glean insights about the consumer and their current or future wants and needs; using the Mastercard network to provide cardholders with personalized, instant offers happening at the point of sale, and the overall digital experience of how each consumer engages.The study found that 62 percent of respondents in the redeemers' category said they are ‰ÛÏvery satisfied‰Ûù with their respective redemption process and programs, but that they desire the freedom to redeem loyalty points at will and without restriction. Respondents added that banking apps should improve features such as redemption and reward functionality, specifically referring to the availability of point balances via mobile.And a redeemer is quite the jet-setter: High-volume cardholders reported greater usage of travel redemptions, while younger cardholders skewed higher for travel and event tickets. Low-volume cardholders utilize financial services rewards programs for more practical needs, such as grocery store rewards, illustrating a preference to ‰ÛÏsave money on things they do every day.‰Ûù To further bolster the growth of loyalty redemption in the travel sector, Pay with Rewards offers enhanced concierge, new guarantees, partnerships, offerings and ‰ÛÏPriceless Cities,‰Ûù which connects Mastercard members to unique experiences around the world.Thirty percent of non-redeemers said they have not redeemed a reward in the last year or longer, and 20 percent of that group stated they had not found the ‰ÛÏopportunity‰Ûù to redeem, suggesting that a more mobile and streamlined redemption process may encourage loyalty usage and spending. And 9 percent of respondents switched cards in the last year, citing ‰ÛÏRewards Offer‰Ûù as the number-one reason why they chose their new card, among other reasons such as annual percentage rate offers, balance transfers and special introductory rates, which accounted for only 7 percent, the report said. The survey found that less than 50 percent of respondents said they could identify any of the benefit and incentive options available on their cards, pointing to a generally low awareness of card benefits.Sixty percent of Millennials in the under-redeemers category said they would switch to a bank that offered rewards for additional ‰ÛÏbanking behaviors,‰Ûù and maintaining balances was one of the more popular rewarding behavior options tested, the firm said. Interestingly, 60 percent of under-redeemer respondents either cannot redeem at all, do not know if they can redeem at checkout, or are unaware as to whether their points can be used to buy things on the fly, though they may be accustomed to redeeming points online.However, 69 percent of under-redeemers would redeem at checkout or point-of-sale if given the option, while 24 percent said the incentive would likely result in greater use of their card. Eight percent said they would switch to banks offering this redemption option and 26 percent of Millennials said they would switch banks specifically to employ this feature, illustrating the pull of a clear, frictionless shopping experience.For More Business News From WWD, See:Applied DNA Sciences to Create Anti-Counterfeiting Sewing ThreadSustainable Polymers Popularize Across Textile Markets","Good things come in threes.The program‰Ûªs accompanying slogan, ‰ÛÏIt‰Ûªs your points, your way,‰Ûù is modeled after the modern-day consumer, as it reflects shoppers‰Ûª desire for frictionless and meaningful spending.He added, ""Often when people think about loyalty, they think the value is the points that you get.And that's certainly an important part, but I think at Mastercard what we're thinking about is a much broader spectrum when we bring our loyalty services together.""And 9 percent of respondents switched cards in the last year, citing ‰ÛÏRewards Offer‰Ûù as the number-one reason why they chose their new card, among other reasons such as annual percentage rate offers, balance transfers and special introductory rates, which accounted for only 7 percent, the report said.","['contextual', 'programs', 'services', 'study', 'loyalty', 'defined', 'respondents', 'mastercards', 'redeem', 'consumer', 'points', 'rewards', 'consumers', 'mastercard', 'redemption']",,,"['Tracey Greenstein', 'Joelle Diderich', 'Jennifer Weil', 'Katya Foreman']",2018-05-24 04:30:50+00:00,http://wwd.com/business-news/technology/consumers-loyalty-mastercards-rewards-study-1202679819/,,,,

"Visa, Mastercard Beat On Holiday Shopping; Visa Shares Fall","Credit-card giant Visa (V) on Thursday reported fiscal first-quarter results after the close that beat estimates, helped by solid holiday spending and e-commerce. The company also OK'd a $7.5 billion buyback, after some rivals said they would cut or suspend theirs.Earlier in the day, Mastercard (MA) also reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings as holiday shoppers spent more on their credit and debit cards.Visa earned $1.08 a share, a 26% jump, beating estimates for 90 cents. Revenue of $4.86 billion, a 9% increase, topped forecasts for $4.815 billion.Payments volume for the quarter jumped 10%, with cross-border volume up 9% and processed transactions up 12%.CEO Alfred Kelly said in a statement that in the wake of President Trump's tax bill signed into law in December, the company was ""evaulating ways"" to invest more in its business in part to digitize payments.Visa also said it expects an effective tax rate of roughly 23%, with a six percentage point reduction due to the tax cuts, and it said the legislation would would add to EPS.But it kept its revenue growth outlook for the year to the ""high single digits"" on a nominal dollar basis. And the company forecast operating expense growth to come in at the ""high end of mid-single digits"". In October, Visa said it expected operating expenses to grow in the ""mid-single digits.""Operating margin dipped 1 percentage point during the quarter, while operating expenses rose 13%.Shares were down 1.6% after hours in the stock market today. Visa had closed up 1.2% to 125.72.MastercardX Mastercard, meanwhile, said EPS rose to $1.14 a share, beating expectations for $1.12, while revenue rose 20% to $3.31 billion.Switched transactions rose 17% to 17.7 billion. Cross-border volumes rose 17% on a local currency basis. Gross dollar volume increased 13% to $1.4 trillion on a local currency basis.Operating expenses grew 28%, while adjusted operating expenses were up 15%.Mastercard shares closed up 2.3% to 172.93, though off session highs of 176.71. The stock was unchanged late.IBD'S TAKE: With thousands of publicly traded companies to choose from, how can you quickly find the best stocks to buy right now? A good starting point is to regularly review screens that highlight the top-rated equities.The results arrive after some department stores, like Macy's (M) and JCPenney (JCP), and other big-box retailers like Target (TGT), turned out encouraging holiday-period sales.Amazon (AMZN), meanwhile, has fattened its share of online retail sales during the holidays, according to GBH Insights figures cited by MarketWatch. Amazon reported earnings after Thursday's closing bell.But Nomura analyst Bill Carcache said the GOP's new tax legislation would create ""noise"" due to one-time impacts that the law ‰ÛÓ be it a benefit or a hit to earnings ‰ÛÓ will have on the credit-card companies' profit.Analysts generally expect the economy and finance industry to benefit from the GOP's new tax legislation once the sector digests write-downs, taxes on foreign earnings and other effects.American Express (AXP) ‰ÛÓ which issues credit cards directly, unlike card networks Visa and Mastercard ‰ÛÓ this month said it would suspend share buybacks for the first half of this year after a one-time, $2.6 billion charge related to the law chewed up a big part of its fourth-quarter profit.AmEx said it would halt repurchasing shares to gather up more capital after sustaining that charge, which stemmed largely from a repatriation tax on some foreign earnings and a lower value of deferred tax assets and liabilities. Companies can accumulate deferred tax assets during losses and use them to ease their tax burden.American Express stock crept up 0.25% on Thursday. Visa and American Express are members of the Dow Jones industrial average.In December, Capital One Financial said it would cut its buyback due to similar charges.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:PayPal Shares Plunge On eBay Contract Exit; Adyen Moves In For DealAlibaba Falls Short On Earnings, Takes 33% Stake In Ant FinancialAmazon Health Care Disruption Fears Clash With This RealityToronto Dominion Bank Trying To Close In On Key Technical Measure","Credit-card giant Visa (V) on Thursday reported fiscal first-quarter results after the close that beat estimates, helped by solid holiday spending and e-commerce.Earlier in the day, Mastercard (MA) also reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings as holiday shoppers spent more on their credit and debit cards.In October, Visa said it expected operating expenses to grow in the ""mid-single digits.""Operating margin dipped 1 percentage point during the quarter, while operating expenses rose 13%.Operating expenses grew 28%, while adjusted operating expenses were up 15%.","['shares', 'visa', 'stock', 'holiday', 'fall', 'shopping', 'billion', 'rose', 'share', 'volume', 'tax', 'beat', 'operating', 'mastercard', 'earnings', 'expenses']",,,"[""Investor'S Business Daily"", 'Bill Peters']",2018-02-01 14:09:17-07:00,https://www.investors.com/news/mastercard-earnings-strong-visa-due-tonight/,,,,

PayPal-Mastercard deal goes global,"BI IntelligenceThis story was delivered to BI Intelligence ""Payments Briefing"" subscribers. To learn more and subscribe, please click here.PayPal and Mastercard are taking their strategic partnership fully global, announcing a ""significant expansion"" to Canada, Europe, Latin America and the Caribbean, and the Middle East and North Africa on Thursday. Previously, the firms had inked deals in the APAC region and the US.The partnership will extend the joint services the companies offer in existing markets, including easier access to Mastercard as a default option in PayPal apps, the ability to cash out to Mastercard debit cards, and in-store contactless payments anywhere that accepts contactless Mastercard.The move comes at a time when PayPal has been doubling down on partnerships. In the past two years, PayPal has inked at least 18 partnerships with leading companies, including card networks like Mastercard, Visa, and Discover, mobile wallets, and tech firms, as well as others. That's marked a distinct shift in strategy for the firm; previously, it tried to beat out the competition, but is now attempting to work with peers in a move to become a more omnipresent player in consumers' financial lives. This would allow consumers to turn to PayPal for more of their financial needs ‰ÛÓ from bill payment and peer-to-peer (P2P) to brick-and-mortar shopping ‰ÛÓ and to do so with the payment method of their choice.That's led to gains that increasing global scope could improve upon.PayPal is rising quickly. In Q2 2017, the firm's total payment volume (TPV) hit $106 billion, up 26% annually. Some of that growth is driven by increased choice ‰ÛÓ the benefit of the deals with Mastercard and other networks ‰ÛÓ which is reportedly increasing customer adds while driving up average spend per consumer. It's also driven by mobile volume, which hit $36 billion, and has been growing at 50% annually. Leaning into these gains could be a solid growth strategy for the firm.In Q2 2017, the firm's total payment volume (TPV) hit $106 billion, up 26% annually.

And increasing global scope with high-profile players could accelerate that growth.Mastercard accounted for 26% of global card transactions and 16% of total cards in 2016, making it a top player. By making it easier for customers in markets worldwide to pay with a method they already like, and use regularly, in PayPal, the firm could tie customers more tightly to its service. And that could be particularly beneficial in two markets that the global partnership helps Mastercard access: places where contactless payments are already popular, like Europe, which leaves PayPal room to capture that volume, and in emerging and developing markets with a rapidly digitizing payments ecosystem, like Latin America and the Caribbean and MENA, where PayPal could gain an early mover advantage.","PayPal and Mastercard are taking their strategic partnership fully global, announcing a ""significant expansion"" to Canada, Europe, Latin America and the Caribbean, and the Middle East and North Africa on Thursday.That's led to gains that increasing global scope could improve upon.In Q2 2017, the firm's total payment volume (TPV) hit $106 billion, up 26% annually.In Q2 2017, the firm's total payment volume (TPV) hit $106 billion, up 26% annually.And increasing global scope with high-profile players could accelerate that growth.Mastercard accounted for 26% of global card transactions and 16% of total cards in 2016, making it a top player.","['paypalmastercard', 'mastercard', 'paypal', 'payments', 'deal', 'markets', 'growth', 'increasing', 'volume', 'global', 'hit', 'goes', 'payment']",,,"['Jaime Toplin', 'Oct.']",10/6/17 0:00,http://www.businessinsider.com/paypal-mastercard-deal-goes-global-2017-10,,,,

Mastercard: Now‰Û_and Later,"Last Thursday, Mastercard (MA) held its investor day, one that was well received by investors, as the stock gained 2.7% that day. So what can it do for an encore? How about gain again thanks to a Guggenheim upgrade.Last Thursday, Mastercard raised its 2017 sales guidance, and predicted that it would grow earnings from 2016-2018 by a compound annual growth rate of 20% or so. And that was enough for Guggenheim's Jeff Cantwell to upgrade Mastercard's stock today. He explains why:Bottom line, we're now expecting better top-line growth (14%/12% in '17E/'18E, compared to our prior 13%/10%) driven by MA's digital strategy and further expansion in international markets, and greater operating leverage (3%/5% in '17E/'18E vs. 1%/3% prior) versus consensus. As a result of these dynamics, we see potential EPS upside to consensus forecasts (Guggenheim: 4% above in '18E). In addition to MA's positive N-T catalysts, we also believe the company has a unique L-T revenue driver from its expansion into Faster Payments, which moves the company beyond card-based payment solutions. We expect MA will see incremental top-line growth from areas like B2B, P2P, and B2C. As such, we expect MA will sustain its current high rate of EPS growth beyond '18E as these new revenue opportunities layer in.Shares of Mastercard have gained 2.6% to $140.76, more than double Visa's (V) 1% rise to $105.43.","Last Thursday, Mastercard (MA) held its investor day, one that was well received by investors, as the stock gained 2.7% that day.Last Thursday, Mastercard raised its 2017 sales guidance, and predicted that it would grow earnings from 2016-2018 by a compound annual growth rate of 20% or so.We expect MA will see incremental top-line growth from areas like B2B, P2P, and B2C.As such, we expect MA will sustain its current high rate of EPS growth beyond '18E as these new revenue opportunities layer in.Shares of Mastercard have gained 2.6% to $140.76, more than double Visa's (V) 1% rise to $105.43.","['guggenheim', 'stock', 'topline', 'rate', 'revenue', 'ma', 'mas', 'growth', 'nowand', 'mastercard', 'prior', 'later']",,,['Ben Levisohn'],,http://www.barrons.com/articles/mastercard-nowand-later-1505139757,,,,

The Average Daily Trading Volume (ADTV) demonstrates trading activity related to the liquidity of the security. When Ave Volume tends to increase, it shows enhanced liquidity. But when Ave Volume is lower, the security will tend to be cheap as people are not as keen to purchase it. Hence, it might have an effect on the worth of the security.Nowadays, the importance of stock analysis is on the rise in stock exchange market. In essence, stock analysts put their best efforts to measure the future activity of a trading mechanism and market. One can make this analysis in two unique ways, including fundamental stock analysis and technical stock analysis. The stock analysts must have an in-depth knowledge about the stock market, sector and trends so that they could make their precise, accurate and concrete analysis over the changing trends in the stock market.Stock‰Ûªs Performance Analysis:The stock has turned around 61.03% yearly, so it gives a chance to investors, traders, shareholders and stakeholders to take a look at the complete situation of the market. The stock has come back -0.20% weekly shift, because it was maintained at 9.23% in the one month period. Hence, this depicts the stock‰Ûªs weekly as well as monthly performance. The market capitalization of the corporation settled $201.04B whereas it‰Ûªs P/B Ratio was 35.29. By using the P/B Ratio methodology, you can compare the value of stock market to its book value.

Financial investors own 0.10% stake in the business, while Beta Factor, which is generally used to evaluate the riskiness of the security, was moved 1.18.Stock‰Ûªs Technical Analysis:In order to analyze stock, you should review its technical values regularly. In this way, moving average (MA) is one of the best technical indicators for experts. One can easily calculate and measure stock using moving average charts, diagrams and commanding visual trend-spotting tool. There are countless types of simple moving averages, but the most important ones are three, including SMA20, SMA50, and SMA200. When we talk about SMA20, it is commonly used for short term trading analysis. Using SMA20, you can see the primary trends of the stock market. On the other hand, there is SMA50, which is often used by stock traders for evaluating mid-term trends of the market. Lastly, SMA200 can be used by traders to evaluate the long term trends of the stock market.Most stakeholders will rummage around for a cross above or below this average to symbolize when the stock is in a bullish trend or a bearish trend. Meanwhile, shares of the company were making trade 2.89% away from the 20-days SMA and 20.77% away from the 200-days SMA. Currently, the stock is trading -1.59% ahead of its 52-week high and 62.97% beyond its 52-week low. So, both the price and 52-week high indicators would give you a clear-cut picture to evaluate the price direction. The market price signifies the current price at which as asset or a service of the company is bought or sold. Market price emerges with the trends of both supply and demand in the market.Where Do Relative Strength Index (RSI) Stands?Perhaps, it is one of the most important indicators, because it is used in the technical analysis of the stock in the money market. The relative strength index (RSI) is claimed to depict the latest and past performances of the stock market, based upon the ending price volumes of the current trading period. The RSI is characterized as a momentum oscillator, evaluating the speed and scale of directional price shifts. The momentum exemplifies both rising and falling rates of the Price in the stock market. Using RSI, you can calculate momentum as the percentage of elevated closes to reduced closes. But if the stocks have experienced optimistic changes rapidly, then it might have an increased RSI than stocks. So, it might cause negative changes in the market.The RSI index is largely used by traders on a 14-day time period and is evaluated on a range from 0 to 100, along with both high and low volumes marked at 70 and 30, correspondingly. Both the shorter and longer timeframes are used by the traders for shorter and longer purposes. It further adds high and low ranges like from 80 to 20 and from 90 to 10. This trend takes place less repeatedly. However, it represents stronger momentum in the market. In the meantime, the Mastercard Incorporated‰Ûªs 14-day RSI was settled at 65.26. All in all, the trends of the stock market were shifting slowly but surely.Disclaimer: Any news, report, research and analysis published on FinanceRater.com are only for information purposes.

Mastercard Aims to Transform Sri Lanka‰Ûªs Digital Payments Landscape with Mastercard QR,"2018-05-24 11:51:27Mastercard unveiled Mastercard‰Ûªs Merchant Presented QR payment solution in Sri Lanka, a safe and secure Quick Response (QR) based mobile payments solution. The solution enables shoppers to safely pay using a mobile application with a standardized QR code support to scan the merchant-presented QR code, which works on smartphones. Ushering in a new era for digital payments in the island nation, Mastercard QR can easily be integrated into existing mobile payment solutions offered by financial service providers and works with existing Mastercard cards as well.‰ÛÏMastercard is excited to bring Mastercard QR to Sri Lanka, one of its key focus markets in South Asia. Continuing to support the country‰Ûªs ongoing efforts to encourage adoption of cashless payments, Mastercard seeks to simplify access to digital payments for businesses and consumers through this fast, secure, convenient and cost-effective solution,‰Ûù said R. B. Santosh Kumar, Country Manager, Sri Lanka and Maldives, Mastercard.Mastercard QR enables merchants to accept Mastercard payments using a simple EMV Co standard QR code that merchants can display at their Point of Sale (POS) without the need for any physical equipment. They can also use a dynamic EMV Co QR code generated on the merchant‰Ûªs mobile device. It is a low cost and easy-to-deploy technology, designed to benefit every merchant, whether they are based in a major city or a remote area. Thus, it opens up a world of opportunities to small and micro merchants across the country who are challenged by a traditional terminal approach for payments.‰ÛÏThe initial response on Mastercard QR from Mastercard's local customers and partners has been very encouraging. Mastercard is working together to integrate it into their existing systems. We look forward to seeing many more merchants and consumers availing the convenience and security of digital payments through solutions such as Mastercard QR,‰Ûù added Santosh.The release of the EMVCo QR Codes Specification in July 2017 has further propelled the proliferation of the interoperable QR Standards of QR Payments across Asia. These standards mean that merchants can now display a single QR code to accept different types of payments, and significantly simplifies the consumer and merchant experience in QR payments. Besides the successful launch in India in 2016, Mastercard is working closely with banks and non-banking financial service providers to roll this out in other countries like Thailand, Vietnam, Taiwan and Singapore.* Dailymirror.lk neither liable nor responsible for any information / contents published in this article","2018-05-24 11:51:27Mastercard unveiled Mastercard‰Ûªs Merchant Presented QR payment solution in Sri Lanka, a safe and secure Quick Response (QR) based mobile payments solution.‰ÛÏMastercard is excited to bring Mastercard QR to Sri Lanka, one of its key focus markets in South Asia.Mastercard QR enables merchants to accept Mastercard payments using a simple EMV Co standard QR code that merchants can display at their Point of Sale (POS) without the need for any physical equipment.‰ÛÏThe initial response on Mastercard QR from Mastercard's local customers and partners has been very encouraging.The release of the EMVCo QR Codes Specification in July 2017 has further propelled the proliferation of the interoperable QR Standards of QR Payments across Asia.","['lanka', 'solution', 'digital', 'sri', 'lankas', 'payments', 'aims', 'mobile', 'qr', 'transform', 'landscape', 'code', 'merchant', 'mastercard', 'merchants']",,,[],,http://www.dailymirror.lk/article/Mastercard-Aims-to-Transform-Sri-Lanka-s-Digital-Payments-Landscape-with-Mastercard-QR-150343.html,,,,

"Vipera, Mastercard Launch SME Pay Tool","Mobile financial services firm Vipera has announced the launch of SME Pay, a solution to help small businesses (SMBs) manage company spend, the company said Tuesday (March 6).SME Pay integrates with the Mastercard Business Card, enabling business owners to set controls on employee use of the card. Vipera‰Ûªs solution is mobile app-based, enabling entrepreneurs to manage employee spend from their mobile devices. The company noted SME Pay is also linked to a mobile POS device, with the platform able to view and manage income and expenditure based on the influx of transaction data.Cards linked to SME Pay can be customized based on team member, while managers can control ATM cash withdrawal, transaction limits, online payment controls and more.‰ÛÏWe are delighted to be launching SME Pay in collaboration with Mastercard,‰Ûù said Vipera CEO Marco Casartelli in a statement. ‰ÛÏSME Pay will help small business owners manage their business spending and improve their cash flow. It is a safe and simple solution that will mean staff no longer have to handle cash and spending can be controlled. We look forward to rolling out this new and innovative solution.‰ÛùThe companies said they will be demonstrating the solution at Finovate Europe, held in London.Spend management is among the largest challenges for small business owners, according to research. Center, a spend management firm, released a report last year which found that entrepreneurs struggle to set flexible spending goals and lack real-time visibility into spend data and budgets. Most SMBs surveyed (88 percent) said they don‰Ûªt use any kind of budgeting software, and 55 percent said they set their company budgets just once a year.Mastercard has introduced several new solutions designed for the small and medium-sized business community in recent months. Last year, the payments company debuted the Mastercard B2B hub, an accounts payable, invoice management and payment processing solution for SMBs.","Mobile financial services firm Vipera has announced the launch of SME Pay, a solution to help small businesses (SMBs) manage company spend, the company said Tuesday (March 6).SME Pay integrates with the Mastercard Business Card, enabling business owners to set controls on employee use of the card.Cards linked to SME Pay can be customized based on team member, while managers can control ATM cash withdrawal, transaction limits, online payment controls and more.‰ÛÏWe are delighted to be launching SME Pay in collaboration with Mastercard,‰Ûù said Vipera CEO Marco Casartelli in a statement.‰ÛÏSME Pay will help small business owners manage their business spending and improve their cash flow.","['launch', 'small', 'business', 'sme', 'solution', 'vipera', 'pay', 'spending', 'company', 'mobile', 'spend', 'tool', 'manage', 'mastercard']",,,[],2018-03-07 08:00:06+00:00,https://www.pymnts.com/news/b2b-payments/2018/vipera-mastercard-sme-pay/,,,,
Mastercard open sources blockchain API to help make payments more secure and transparent,"On Friday, Mastercard opened its blockchain technology via its API to developers, allowing select consumers, businesses, and banks to begin making transactions using the ledger technology.For those unfamiliar, blockchain is the technology that allows Bitcoin and other digital currencies to be open, anonymous, and secure. It is a master ledger or database that contains metadata about when and how each transaction occurred, which is open to members of a given network and is cryptographically secured to prevent tampering.Mastercard's blockchain solution can power secure, seamless non-card payment transactions, including business-to-business (B2B) payments and trade finance transactions, according to a press release. The company will initially open its blockchain technology to the B2B space, to address issues of speed, transparency, and costs in cross-border payments, according to a press release.Combined with Mastercard's existing payment capabilities‰ÛÓincluding virtual cards, Mastercard Send, and Vocalink‰ÛÓthe company will support all types of cross-border B2B payments, including those that are account-based, blockchain-based, or card-based, the release noted.SEE: Blockchain: The smart person's guideMastercard's blockchain includes new privacy, flexibility, and scalability offerings, including combining with the company's other APIs to create a range of new applications. Mastercard's blockchain is also integrated into the company's payment network, which includes 22,000 financial institutions.""By combining Mastercard blockchain technology with our settlement network and associated network rules, we have created a solution that is safe, secure, auditable and easy to scale,"" said Ken Moore, executive vice president of Mastercard Labs, in the release. ""When it comes to payments, we want to provide choice and flexibility to our partners where they are able to seamlessly use both our existing and new payment rails based on the needs and requirements of their customers.""Potential blockchain use cases include proof of provenance, to easily track high-value products such as pharmaceuticals, art, and luxury goods as they are created, transferred, purchased, and re-sold. For example, users can use a Mastercard credit card at a standard ATM to record that an asset arrived at a location on the blockchain‰ÛÓhelping to avoid contributing to the $1.4 trillion cost of fraudulent goods globally, Mastercard noted on its website.Vehicle service history is also easier to track using the blockchain, as car owners and authorized dealers can share information with each other privately to facilitate payments. For example, if an owner gets a car serviced, the garage can write details about the service to the blockchain, and only authorized parties can see those details.Further, the Person-to-Person (P2P) global market is now worth $16 trillion. With Mastercard blockchain, when two people agree to transfer funds, they can write a settlement request to the blockchain. Then, the Mastercard Settlement network will read the blockchain and transfer the funds between the two banks, writing a confirmation of transfer to the blockchain as well.Other top uses for blockchain include stocks, shipping, and law, according to TechRepublic's Tom Merritt. Mastercard faces competition in this space from companies such as IBM, which recently announced a blockchain banking solution that allows financial institutions to more quickly and cost effectively process payments across international borders.Mastercard also recently joined the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance, the world's largest open source blockchain initiative that aims to connect Fortune 500 companies, startups, academics, and tech vendors with blockchain subject matter experts.Image: iStockphoto/monsitjThe 3 big takeaways for TechRepublic readers1. Mastercard's blockchain technology API is now available to select banks and merchants to begin making transactions using the ledger technology.2. The company will initially open its blockchain technology to the B2B space, to address issues of speed, transparency, and costs in cross-border payments.3.

"What Drove Visa to an All-Time High, and What Sent PayPal Lower","In this segment of the Motley Fool Money podcast, host Chris Hill is joined by senior Fool analysts Jason Moser, David Kretzmann, and Jeff Fischer for a discussion of a couple of financial stocks. First, Visa's (NYSE:V) latest results, which show that the war on cash continues to be a great place to make money. Its earnings-per-share growth forecast is impressive, global economic growth means more transactions, credit card use relative to cash is rising -- and then there are the international opportunities. The Fools consider the future and the investment thesis for this backbone of the financial services segment.They then chat about one of their favorite war on cash stocks, PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL), which reported its first-quarter results last week. And as the Fools point out, by every measure, it's a strong business turning in strong numbers. Should you open a position?A full transcript follows the video.This video was recorded on April 27, 2018.Chris Hill: Shares of Visa hitting an all-time high this week after second quarter profits came in higher than expected. They also raised guidance. Jeff, Visa, they're not going to get to $1 trillion first, but they are closing in on a market cap of nearly $300 billion.Jeff Fischer: They are. And even at that size, they grew revenue 13%, and they grew earnings per share 30% year over year. Now, 10% of that was thanks to the new tax law. So, without that, they grew around 20%. Still really impressive. For the whole year, they expect earnings per share to grow in the high 20% range. The stock trades at that same multiple to earnings, so it looks reasonable.What's happening, Chris, is economic activity continues to pick up around the world. Plus, cash continues to get eaten away by credit card usage. And, there's been a lot more cross-border economic activity, which is high margin, even higher margin, for Visa and Mastercard (NYSE:MA). And, there's India to consider. 1.4 billion people there. Visa is the market leader there by quite a wide margin, has all the deals in place, and it's still just getting started there. It sees a lot of opportunity in India. It's also filed to start transaction business in China, which is still a few years down the road, but still.Hill: Is that a big market?Fischer: It's fairly big, it's about the size of New Jersey. [laughs] So, a majority of the world is still in the future for Visa. Meanwhile, the company is celebrating its 10 years on the market. It went public 10 years ago already, which is hard to believe. An 837% return for those Fools who bought and kept the stock. I don't think it'll do 800% again in the next ten years, but I could see 200-300%.David Kretzmann: The thing that really appeals to me when it comes to Mastercard and Visa is, they're almost platform-agnostic. Whether you're paying through PayPal, Square, Stripe, any of these different platforms, you're usually going to be using your Visa or Mastercard credit card. They just seem like companies that are going to win almost regardless of which of these platforms end up duking it out and coming out on top.Fischer: So true, David, and a great point. They have relationships with Square Cash and Venmo and a giant relationship with PayPal. So, you're right, they're integrated in all these new ways to pay, as well.Hill: Speaking of Venmo, PayPal's first quarter profits rose 33%, but that wasn't enough to keep shares from PayPal falling just a little bit this week. I'm assuming, Jason, this is due to valuation, because there was a lot to like in PayPal's quarter.Jason Moser: Yeah. I mean, I think it's the voting vs. weighing. We tend to look longer-term, weighing these companies. You can't really speak to the market voting in the short-term. It's funny, I always get a funny look when people ask, ""What's one of your favorite stock ideas out there?"" And I say, ""PayPal."" And they look at me funny like, ""PayPal? Really?"" They just don't get it. Let me see if I can elaborate here a little bit.In the quarter, revenue was up 24% to $3.7 billion. 2.2 billion payment transactions went through PayPal platforms. $132 billion total payment volume. 237 million active accounts. They processed $49 billion in mobile payment volume in the quarter. That was up 52% year over year. Mobile payments now represent 37% of the business' total payment volume. So, there are a lot of big numbers there.That's all to say that PayPal has done a very good job at building out a tremendously valuable network that provides a very valuable service for a lot of people. And I'll tell you what, we were just talking about this race to $1 trillion, and I think I know the way that Microsoft gets there first -- they buy PayPal. Right? I mean, they need that mobile presence, and that would be tremendous right there. They actually have the cash on the balance sheet, they could make a nice little offer and probably do that, if antitrust would let it slide.Hill: If you're a PayPal shareholder, do you want that to happen?Moser: [laughs] No! I am a PayPal shareholder, and I don't want that. I'm just simply making the point that, if Microsoft wants to win this race, that could be one way to do it.Fischer: Why are you giving them that idea, then?Moser: You're supposing they're listening. I don't know that that's the case.Fischer: Somebody at Microsoft is.","They then chat about one of their favorite war on cash stocks, PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL), which reported its first-quarter results last week.Chris Hill: Shares of Visa hitting an all-time high this week after second quarter profits came in higher than expected.Jeff, Visa, they're not going to get to $1 trillion first, but they are closing in on a market cap of nearly $300 billion.And, there's been a lot more cross-border economic activity, which is high margin, even higher margin, for Visa and Mastercard (NYSE:MA).2.2 billion payment transactions went through PayPal platforms.","['cash', 'really', 'visa', 'lower', 'sent', 'alltime', 'paypal', 'billion', 'drove', 'youre', 'lot', 'theyre', 'high', 'quarter', 'payment']",,,['Motley Fool Staff'],5/3/18 0:00,https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/05/03/what-drove-visa-to-an-all-time-high-and-what-sent.aspx,,,,
Mastercard Pioneers Remote Biometric Card Enrollment,"Bob Reany, executive vice president of identity solutions at Mastercard, unveils techonlogy advancement that allows people to register their fingerprint onto their biometric card from the comfort of their home. (Photo: Business Wire)Bob Reany, executive vice president of identity solutions at Mastercard, unveils techonlogy advancement that allows people to register their fingerprint onto their biometric card from the comfort of their home. (Photo: Business Wire)MIAMI--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Mastercard today unveiled a technology advancement for its biometric cards. With biometrics representing the next generation in securing payments, Mastercard developed a way for people to easily and conveniently register their fingerprint onto the biometric card in the comfort of their home.Mastercard is on a mission to eliminate the use of passwords and recognize people by ‰ÛÏwhat they are‰Ûù instead of ‰ÛÏwhat they know‰Ûù through biometrics like fingerprints, facial recognition and iris scans. Advances in technology are making biometric payment a reality, and through significant research and development, a revolutionary battery-powered sleeve will now let people self-enroll their contact or contactless biometric card. Their fingerprint is scanned by the sensor on the card and an encrypted digital template is created and securely stored.‰ÛÏMaking life safer and simpler for consumers is the cornerstone of our efforts around biometrics and comes through the use of some incredibly sophisticated technology,‰Ûù said Bob Reany, executive vice president of identity solutions at Mastercard. ‰ÛÏPeople love the security our biometric card delivers because we put their needs first. The card draws power from the payment terminal so it can be used anywhere, we use a flexible biometric scanner so it‰Ûªs more durable, and now we have a sleeve to register fingerprints so people don‰Ûªt have to make a trip to a bank branch.‰ÛùSimplifying the registration process will help speed adoption of biometrics by issuers and consumers alike. The solution is a cost-effective way for issuers to deliver biometric cards at scale without requiring additional infrastructure in branches. With the biometric card, consumers get a secure experience they love and can use at any EMV terminal either by contact or contactless payment. Issuers benefit from improved fraud detection and prevention, approval rates and customer loyalty. And, for merchants, the biometric card works with existing EMV card terminals so there is no additional cost or burden.In 2017, Mastercard was the first to introduce biometric cards that combine chip technology with fingerprints to securely verify the cardholder‰Ûªs identity for in-store purposes ‰ÛÒ all without requiring an internal battery. When shopping and paying in-store, the biometric card works like any other card at EMV card terminals globally. The cardholder simply places their finger on the embedded sensor and either dips or taps the card as normal. Powered by the terminal itself, the fingerprint is verified against the template and ‰ÛÒ if the biometrics match ‰ÛÒ the transaction can then be approved with the card never leaving the consumer‰Ûªs hand.About MastercardMastercard (NYSE:MA), www.mastercard.com, is a technology company in the global payments industry. Our global payments processing network connects consumers, financial institutions, merchants, governments and businesses in more than 210 countries and territories. Mastercard products and solutions make everyday commerce activities ‰ÛÒ such as shopping, traveling, running a business and managing finances ‰ÛÒ easier, more secure and more efficient for everyone.

"Here‰Ûªs some good news for value investors: The Southern Company (SO), Uniti Group Inc. (UNIT)","The Southern Company (NYSE:SO) is expensive when one looks at the company‰Ûªs price to sales ratio of 1.83 and compares it with other companies in the The Southern Company group. Its industry average valuation of 3.52 is significantly worse than the sector‰Ûªs 2.46. In the past 13-year record, this ratio went down as low as 1.23 and as high as 2.89. Also, it is down from 56% of the total 618 rivals across the globe.SO traded at an unexpectedly low level on 05/22/2018 when the stock experienced a 0.25% gain to a closing price of $43.55. The company saw 4.64 million shares trade hands over the course of the day. Given that its average daily volume over the 30 days has been 5.52 million shares a day, this signifies a pretty significant change over the norm.Analysts are speculating a 21.7% move, based on the high target price ($53) for the shares that is set to reach in the next 12 months. The analysts, on average, are forecasting a $46.92 price target, but the stock is already up 2.76% from its recent lows. However, the stock is trading at -18.61% versus recent highs ($53.51). Analysts believe that we could see stock price minimum in the $43 range (lowest target price), allowing for another -1.26% drop from its current position. Leading up to this report, we have seen a -3.74% fall in the stock price over the last 30 days and a 1.47% increase over the past 3 months. Overall, the share price is down -9.44% so far this year. Additionally, SO had a day price range of $43.28 to $43.85.Heading into the stock price potential, The Southern Company needs to grow just 5.63% to cross its median price target of $46. In order to determine directional movement, the 50-day and 200-day moving averages for The Southern Company (NYSE:SO) are $44.89 and $46.32. Given that liquidity is king in short-term, SO is a stock with 1.03 billion shares outstanding that normally trades 3.2% of its float. The stock price recently experienced a 5-day loss of -1.49% with 0.75 average true range (ATR). SO has a beta of 0.04 and RSI is 42.49.Investors also need to beware of the Uniti Group Inc. (NASDAQ:UNIT) valuations. The stock trades on a P/S of 3.7, which suggests that the shares are attractive compared with peers. The broad Uniti Group Inc. industry has an average P/S ratio of 9.54, which is significantly better than the sector‰Ûªs 349.06. In the past 4-year record, this ratio went down as low as 2.66 and as high as 10.72. Also, it is up from 87% of the total 655 rivals across the globe.Uniti Group Inc. by far traveled 45.47% versus a 1-year low price of $13.81. The share price was last seen 0.3% higher, reaching at $20.09 on 05/22/2018. At recent session, the prices were hovering between $19.92 and $20.13. This company shares are -0.45% up from its target price of $20 and the current market capitalization stands at $3.55B. The recent change has given its price a 15.05% lead over SMA 50 and -27.68% deficit over its 52-week high. The stock witnessed 21.61% gains, 33.13% gains and 26.59% gains for the 1-month, 3-month and 6-month period, respectively. To measure price-variation, we found UNIT‰Ûªs volatility during a week at 1.78% and during a month it has been found around 2.76%.Uniti Group Inc. (UNIT) exchanged hands at an unexpectedly high level of 2.18 million shares over the course of the day. Noting its average daily volume at 2.09 million shares each day over the month, this signifies a pretty significant change over the norm.The market experts are predicting a 34.4% rally, based on the high target price ($27) for Uniti Group Inc. shares that is likely to be hit in the 52 weeks. Analysts anticipate that traders could see stock price minimum in the $14 range (lowest target price). If faced, it would be a -30.31% drop from its current position.

""We envision Overledger becoming a partner for enterprises by helping them overcome the biggest challenges they face when trying to adopt blockchain technology including the lack of interoperability and single ledger-dependence.""""Overledger was designed in response to industry demand for a blockchain technology that inter-connects and opens up closed proprietary blockchain networks to the Internet. This ensures that companies like Mastercard and developers aren't restricted to or limited and entirely dependent on a single technology.

As well as boosting their resilience by limiting their risk and exposure, this also allows them to unlock cost savings by better managing consensus fees, which are set with no option to remediate.""""We are fostering innovation by allowing the use of multiple, different blockchains, to offer their unique solutions to real world problems.

Mastercard's Push for More Inclusive Features,"1 Share Share Tweet Share Share Share Print EmailWhat is a common need among a gig worker seeking a second stream of income, an SMB looking to grow their business in an urban neighborhood, and a city planner hoping to solve the complexities of urban traffic congestion? Craig Vosburg, Mastercard‰Ûªs president of North American markets, told Karen Webster the answer is simple: Data and next-gen digital payments tools that can unlock a more inclusive future for these next-gen workers, the SMBs looking to grow their businesses and the city governments wanting to maximize their investments in infrastructure and city services.And, yes, even, in developed economies like the U.S.Vosburg told Webster that Mastercard knows well the issues of financial inclusion and the need for governments and the private sector to work together to enable access to financial services. Until last week, the card network‰Ûªs highest-profile efforts have been centered in the developing world ‰ÛÒ Latin America, Asia Pacific and Africa ‰ÛÒ in an effort to move cash digital.But over the last 18 months or so, Vosburg told Webster that Mastercard has also been thinking much more deeply about the problems and challenges of financial inclusion in North America in general, and the United States in particular.‰ÛÏThe needs are no less important in the American market,‰Ûù he explained. ‰ÛÏThey do, however, have a different feel because of the nature and level of development of the market, the role of government and the needs of local consumers.‰ÛùAlthough Vosburg acknowledged that developed markets don‰Ûªt offer the ‰ÛÏgreen field‰Ûù advantage that comes from building new products and solutions from the ground up, these markets come with an established infrastructure to build on, and a set of well-established partners to work with.The challenge for Mastercard, Vosburg told Webster, was finding a way to have the inclusion conversation in the U.S. that reflects the real pain points of people and businesses ‰ÛÒ and fosters a more inclusive partnership between the public and private sector.The culmination of that effort, announced last week, is Mastercard‰Ûªs Inclusive Futures project. The effort will address challenges in three key areas: digital solutions to manage finances and speed payments for gig and next-gen workers and small businesses, government services that foster greater innovation and efficiency, and new tools to enable smart cities to support this digitally inclusive future.Finding a FocusInclusive futures, Vosburg acknowledged, started not with a master plan of what to build, but a master plan of who to talk to. And talk they did, he explained ‰ÛÒ to many constituents well outside the normal purview of a global card network: to government officials, civic leaders, religious leaders, non-profits, think tanks, a myriad of private sector organizations, representatives of special interest groups ‰ÛÒ you name the group, and Vosburg said they had a conversation, or many.As densely populated cities are the microcosms of American society, said Vosburg, targeting them made it possible for developed solutions to scale, and even to create network effects in the process. Among those on Mastercard‰Ûªs Inclusive Futures listening tour were New York, Atlanta, Chicago, Cleveland, Oakland and St. Louis.Only then, he said, could he and his team step back and narrow the focus on where to, well, focus: Delivering digital (and faster) payments for gig and next-gen workers, digitizing SMBs as well as municipal services, and using data and digital payments tools to help solve cities‰Ûª most vexing problems, such as traffic congestion.The New WorkerAmong the needs that rose quickly to the top, Vosburg explained, were those of the emerging and expanding category of ‰ÛÏgig‰Ûù workers ‰ÛÒ whose issues, he told Webster, center around the problems of having a variable income stream and a fixed expense stream.The challenges those workers face include more than just getting paid, and getting paid digitally. They also include budgeting, financial planning, scheduling, saving and qualifying for more mainstream financial products that can help with income smoothing.Using Mastercard‰Ûªs existing pre-paid card platform, Vosburg said that he and his team have created solutions that target this expanding class of workers and help alleviate the stresses that the lack of a predictable income stream creates.In addition, he noted, it opened new doors for Mastercard to partner with private sector players, such as Care.com, to extend those solutions to their gig workforce. This partnership is about making it easier for Care.com caregivers to manage variable cash flows and personal finances by providing them with budget management tools and real-time payments for services rendered.‰ÛÏDepending on whose estimate you read, one-third to one-half of American workers will be doing some kind of freelance work in the next year, so these solutions are extremely important,‰Ûù Vosburg said.The New CityEqually important, he noted, is the context in which this next-gen worker lives, and helping that environment become more efficient.‰ÛÏWe heard city planners express real concerns about the resource constraints facing them in managing their own infrastructure and collecting revenue to meet the needs of constituents,‰Ûù Vosburg said, which goes well beyond digitizing paper-based payments.The vision outlined in Mastercard‰Ûªs City Possible private-public initiative is central to giving today‰Ûªs cities the opportunity to become the smart cities of the future, and to delivering a portfolio of next-generation services to its constituents.Vosburg said the challenge there isn‰Ûªt so much a dearth of data and ideas, but being nimble enough to use it to innovate in the context of the municipal environment.Those opportunities, he noted, can range from adding more educational resources to economically underperforming neighborhoods to even more innovative ways to optimize public transportation and ease congestion.‰ÛÏBuilding more subway capacity is very expensive ‰ÛÒ and if trains are overburdened during peak hours, cities have two choices,‰Ûù Vosburg explained. ‰ÛÏThey can build more capacity, or lower demand.‰ÛùVosburg said that in test pilots so far, offering consumers reduced fare incentives for traveling at non-peak times has yielded promising results by reducing usage during those peak hours.‰ÛÏThat is a critical efficiency,‰Ûù he added.The Power of PartnershipIt takes a partnership ‰ÛÒ or, more precisely, lots of them.Delivering an inclusive future for cities, the governments that run them, the people who live and work in them and the businesses that want to grow their businesses in them, is too big of a job to go it alone, Vosburg acknowledged. Only through collaboration can a real impact be made.Vosburg gave the example of a recent exchange with a local government official who wanted to do more to help businesses in a certain neighborhood to bring in more business. Mastercard, Vosburg told this local official, can pinpoint down to the specific block what spending in a neighborhood looks like, and where transactions are lagging. If those areas include a number of cash-heavy businesses, Vosburg said, investing in bringing digital payments to those businesses could help them attract more customers, thus enabling the entire neighborhood to flourish.And those sparks, he told Webster as their conversation wound down, is the point of the program. As of today, Mastercard does not know exactly where this program will go ‰ÛÒ or exactly what services will be built into the inclusive future.‰ÛÏIt starts with interacting with people you wouldn‰Ûªt normally interact with,‰Ûù Vosburg explained. ‰ÛÏThose new connections spark new ideas, and generate newfound enthusiasm for what‰Ûªs possible. That‰Ûªs when you have an opportunity to really make a difference.‰Ûù","The culmination of that effort, announced last week, is Mastercard‰Ûªs Inclusive Futures project.Among those on Mastercard‰Ûªs Inclusive Futures listening tour were New York, Atlanta, Chicago, Cleveland, Oakland and St. Louis.Mastercard, Vosburg told this local official, can pinpoint down to the specific block what spending in a neighborhood looks like, and where transactions are lagging.And those sparks, he told Webster as their conversation wound down, is the point of the program.As of today, Mastercard does not know exactly where this program will go ‰ÛÒ or exactly what services will be built into the inclusive future.","['told', 'businesses', 'vosburg', 'services', 'payments', 'workers', 'webster', 'cities', 'inclusive', 'mastercards', 'push', 'solutions', 'features']",,,[],2018-01-31 07:15:24+00:00,https://www.pymnts.com/mastercard/2018/mastercard-inclusive-futures-craig-vosburg-gig-workers-financial-inclusion/,,,,
Mastercard Seeks Patent for Instant Blockchain Payments Processing,"New patent filings from Mastercard show how the credit card giant is looking at blockchain as a possible means for easing payment settlement times.In a patent application released last week by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, the company describes a blockchain-based database capable of instantaneously processing payments, guaranteeing that merchants don't need to wait days before receiving funds for their products.Further, the filings indicate that the tech would help the firm keep an ongoing record of these transactions, verifying that a vendor was actually paid after a particular sale.The data being stored would include the transaction amount, a guarantee of payment, confirmation of the payment and account profiles for the parties involved. These account profiles will also store each users's balance information, according to the application.As the application details:""There is a need for a technical solution where a payment transaction can be guaranteed in a manner that is readily verifiable by an acquiring financial institution and/or merchant, and where the guarantee can be used in conjunction with multiple types of payment instruments as well as multiple transaction types, including e-commerce transactions.""Mastercard has repeatedly considered blockchain platforms to ease payments. Last month, the company announced it was opening up access to the blockchain tools it was developing in order to facilitate business-to-business transactions.An earlier patent application released in September likewise focused on storing payment histories using a blockchain.Disclosure: Mastercard is an investor in CoinDesk's parent company, Digital Currency Group.Mastercard image via Atstock Productions / ShutterstockThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

"Better Stock: Square, Inc. (SQ) vs. Mastercard (MA)","Square (NYSE:SQ) estimates that by 2025, worldwide credit and debit card payment volume will reach $45 trillion annually. With the world becoming more digital every day -- and with 85% of global transactions still being made in cash -- this colossal market should only continue to grow for decades.Square and Mastercard (NYSE:MA) are two businesses that are poised to profit handsomely from this megatrend. But which is the better buy today?Financial fortitudeLet's take a look at some key metrics to see how these payment leaders stack up in regards to financial strength.Metric Square Mastercard Revenue $2.21 billion $12.50 billion Operating income ($54.21 million) $6.62 billion Net income ($62.81 million) $3.92 billion Operating cash flow $127.71 million $5.56 billion Free cash flow $101.61 million $5.13 billion Cash and investments $866.05 million $7.78 billion Debt $358.57 million $5.42 billionMastercard is a financial titan, with profit and cash flow that dwarf those of Square. And while Square is on solid financial footing with more than $500 million in net cash on its balance sheet, Mastercard's net cash currently checks in at more than $2.3 billion. Thus, this matchup is rather one-sided in regards to financial fortitude, with Mastercard the clear leader.Advantage: MastercardGrowthMastercard may be the more financially sound business at this point in time, but Square is growing much faster.Wall Street expects Square to grow its revenue by more than 33% in 2018 and 28% in 2019, while Mastercard's sales are anticipated to rise by about 16% and 12% during that same time. Moreover, analysts estimate that Square will increase its earnings per share at an incredible 87% annually over the next five years. Mastercard, meanwhile, is expected to grow its EPS by about 20% annually over the next half-decade.With its recent past -- and, more importantly, expected future -- growth exceeding that of its larger rival, Square has the edge here.Advantage: SquareValuationNo better-buy discussion should take place without a look at valuation. Let's now check out some key value metrics for Square and MasterCard, including price-to-sales, price-to-earnings (P/E), and price-to-earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratios.Metric Square Mastercard P/S 7.93 14.79 Trailing P/E N/A 48.17 Forward P/E 60.23 24.94 PEG 1.20 1.44Mastercard's stock is more expensive on a price-to-sales basis, which is to be expected since it's the far more profitable business. On a forward P/E basis, however, Square is the much more expensive stock. But what I find most interesting is that Square's PEG ratio -- which factors in its significantly higher expected EPS growth rate -- is considerably lower than that of Mastercard. And so, rather surprisingly, I'm going to give Square the edge in terms of current valuation.Advantage: SquareThe better buy is...Mastercard and Square are both great options if you're looking for a way to profit from the surging growth of electronic payments. But with its stronger growth prospects and more attractively valued stock, Square is the better buy today.","Square and Mastercard (NYSE:MA) are two businesses that are poised to profit handsomely from this megatrend.With its recent past -- and, more importantly, expected future -- growth exceeding that of its larger rival, Square has the edge here.Let's now check out some key value metrics for Square and MasterCard, including price-to-sales, price-to-earnings (P/E), and price-to-earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratios.On a forward P/E basis, however, Square is the much more expensive stock.But with its stronger growth prospects and more attractively valued stock, Square is the better buy today.","['cash', 'square', 'stock', 'million', 'expected', 'financial', 'billion', 'sq', 'ma', 'better', 'growth', 'vs', 'mastercard', 'pe']",,,"['Joe Tenebruso', 'Joe Honed His Investing Skills As An Analyst For Stock Advisor', 'Fool One', 'Supernova', 'Million Dollar Portfolio', 'Income Investor.

Crypto Company Launches App Aimed to Replace Visa Mastercard Payments,"CHARLESTOWN, St. Kitts and Nevis, May 21, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- MF Chain offers a solution that first solves for a great number of issues in commerce, by leveraging merchant payment integration to unite users, merchants and innovators MF Chain is building a complete, open source blockchain platform. MF Chain's singular goal said simply: help drive cryptocurrency adoption to main street and build a platform with community first as its primary motive.Modern Finance Chain payment processing app that aims to take over visa/mastercardModern Finance Chain is pleased to announce the release of the MF Chain Payment Solution MVP (Minimum Valuable Product). Hosted on the MF Chain Github, a downloadable APK for Android can be found here: https://github.com/mfchainThe design is simple, sleek and intuitive to use. Ensuring ease of integration and merchant adoption was top of mind for the MF Chain development team. Once merchants create and have their account verified, their ability to process payments and begin earning 1% crypto-back is ready for use.Designed specifically to not force users to a proprietary wallet, the payment solution integrates supported cryptocurrency wallets via API. This clever feature provides the merchant with the freedom of choice and power to choose how and where to send their cryptocurrency.Taking payments is just as simple. Once the final amount to be paid is determined, merchants simply enter in the total amount (after any applicable taxes), the MF Chain app converts the cash amount entered into the correlating amount in all cryptocurrencies supported. By simply selecting the crypto the consumer wishes to use, a QR code is displayed for consumers to scan and complete the payment process. Easy.To ensure proper conversion of cash to cryptocurrency, MF Chain has integrated a combination of exchange and aggregator APIs. Updated by the minute, this protects the merchant and consumer in this transaction. To further help mitigate price volatility, merchants can select to have cryptocurrency converted to cash. This also results in the merchant receiving cash in their bank account faster versus the traditional credit card payments that places up to a 3-day hold, simply to process the payment.Freedom. Choice. Rewards. MF Chain's MVP proves crypto as a form of payment is not only rewarding, it solves complexities in traditional commerce.Contact:Modern Finance ChainRaj Dinero(515) 679-0489195438@email4pr.comView original content with multimedia:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/crypto-company-launches-app-aimed-to-replace-visa-mastercard-payments-300651824.htmlSOURCE MF Chain","Modern Finance Chain payment processing app that aims to take over visa/mastercardModern Finance Chain is pleased to announce the release of the MF Chain Payment Solution MVP (Minimum Valuable Product).Hosted on the MF Chain Github, a downloadable APK for Android can be found here: https://github.com/mfchainThe design is simple, sleek and intuitive to use.Designed specifically to not force users to a proprietary wallet, the payment solution integrates supported cryptocurrency wallets via API.To ensure proper conversion of cash to cryptocurrency, MF Chain has integrated a combination of exchange and aggregator APIs.Contact:Modern Finance ChainRaj Dinero(515) 679-0489195438@email4pr.comView original content with multimedia:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/crypto-company-launches-app-aimed-to-replace-visa-mastercard-payments-300651824.htmlSOURCE MF Chain","['payment', 'cryptocurrency', 'cash', 'replace', 'visa', 'app', 'mf', 'solution', 'process', 'payments', 'company', 'launches', 'chain', 'simply', 'aimed', 'merchant', 'mastercard', 'merchants', 'crypto']",,,['Mf Chain'],,https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/crypto-company-launches-app-aimed-to-replace-visa-mastercard-payments-300651824.html,,,,
"Why watch the 2018 Mastercard Memorial Cup: Top prospects, great storylines","The three championship Canadian Hockey League teams plus this year‰Ûªs host are set to drop the puck on the 2018 Mastercard Memorial Cup from Regina, Sask.The 100th edition of the major junior tournament features the host Pats, WHL champion Swift Current Broncos, OHL champion Hamilton Bulldogs and QMJHL champion Acadie-Bathurst Titan. These are the best teams Canadian major junior hockey has to offer this season, and plenty of prospects will be on a big national stage, some of whom we may see in the NHL one day.Surprisingly, none of the three CHL leagues have their regular-season champions at this year‰Ûªs Memorial Cup. Each of the Moose Jaw Warriors (WHL), Sault Ste. Marie Greyhounds (OHL) and Blainville-Boisbriand Armada (QMJHL) were eliminated in their league‰Ûªs playoffs, falling short of the CHL‰Ûªs top tournament.This Memorial Cup also has an interesting mix of big and small markets. While Acadie-Bathurst and Swift Current represent two of the smaller markets in the CHL, Hamilton and host Regina are both large cities.Another interesting wrinkle is that none of this year‰Ûªs teams have had much recent success at the Memorial Cup. The Broncos, fresh off their first WHL title since 1993, are the most recent Memorial Cup winner in this group and their last championship came all the way back in 1989. The Pats last won in 1974 and Acadie-Bathurst has never raised the Cup. The Bulldogs, previously known as the Belleville Bulls, haven‰Ûªt won either, but the city of Hamilton has won it twice: once in 1962 when they were known as the Red Wings, and again in 1976 as the Fincups. The Belleville Bulls last played for the Memorial Cup in 2008, but did not reach the final.The round robin is set to begin Friday night with a game between Regina and Hamilton. Here are some reasons to tune in and watch the 2018 Memorial Cup from beginning to end, and where you can see the games.CANADIAN TEAM NHL PROSPECTS IN THE SPOTLIGHTTwo of the Canadian NHL teams don‰Ûªt have a player at the Memorial Cup. Ottawa and Winnipeg are without prospects at the tournament, but the other five teams have at least one representative.It‰Ûªs hard to say any of these guys are blue-chip prospects as there are no first- or second-rounders in the bunch, but there could be a diamond in the rough here.Leading the way is Will Bitten. The Canadiens prospect was initially ranked as a first-rounder in his 2016 draft year, but was caught up in the Flint Firebirds drama and didn‰Ûªt perform at the level expected. He still managed 30 goals and 65 points in 67 games, totals he hasn‰Ûªt equaled since, but slipped to the third round. He scored 20 goals and 64 points in 62 games this year, his second with the Bulldogs. At the beginning of this season, Canadiens director of player personnel Martin Lapointe talked about Bitten with Sportsnet‰Ûªs Eric Engels:‰ÛÏI like Will‰Ûªs competitiveness, but sometimes he competes the wrong way. He tries to hit guys, be physical, and he wastes a lot of energy doing that. I see him jump to hit a guy, and he‰Ûªs smaller and wasting a lot of energy with that. I want him to go into those battles, but instead of finishing a guy and trying to put him in the fourth row I‰Ûªd rather see him try to dig pucks out. Knock the player off balance with a hip and win the space to come out of the corner. He‰Ûªs quick. I think he has a tendency of ‰ÛÓ when things aren‰Ûªt going well ‰ÛÓ he wants to come out like a pinball. That‰Ûªs not going to be his game at the next level.‰ÛùAnother big one to watch is goalie Stuart Skinner of the Broncos. A third-round pick of the Edmonton Oilers last year, Skinner was acquired by the Broncos from the Lethbridge Hurricanes at the trade deadline. After that trade was made, Skinner‰Ûªs play took off.He posted a .914 save percentage and 2.68 GAA in 25 games with Swift Current, much better numbers then he had in Lethbridge (3.38, .897). In the playoffs Skinner was even better (2.20, .932) and his most impressive performance came in the WHL final, where he outduelled three-time WHL Top Goaltender of the Year, and Team Canada‰Ûªs WJC starter, Carter Hart. Skinner shut out the Everett Silvertips in Game 6 to clinch the title.Here‰Ûªs a quick look at the rest of the Canadian team-affiliated prospects:Glenn Gawdin, Calgary: A six-foot-one centre, Gawdin was a fourth-round pick of St. Louis in 2015, but was left unsigned by the Blues. The Calgary Flames swooped in and signed the 21-year-old to a contract in November and he had a monster year, finishing second in WHL scoring with 125 points in 67 games. The Broncos captain added 32 points in 24 playoff games and was named the post-season MVP.Cale Fleury, Montreal: Brother of Carolina first-round draft pick Haydn, Cale is a six-foot-one defenceman picked in the third round by Montreal in 2017. He was dealt to the Pats this season and will now play for the host team in the Memorial Cup ‰ÛÓ something his brother did for Red Deer in 2016. Cale posted 51 points in 68 games this season, but acknowledges his main strength is his defence.‰ÛÏMy game really needs to be focused on defence first. I‰Ûªm a pretty physical guy, too. I‰Ûªd like to throw some hits, and hopefully join in offensively when I can,‰Ûù he told NHL.com.Cameron Hebig, Edmonton: An undrafted six-foot centre, the 21-year-old Hebig signed on with the Oilers this past December. He was one of the best players on the Saskatoon Blades before being traded to Regina, where he finished with 32 points in 26 games. Hebig scored six goals in the Pats‰Ûª first-round playoff loss.Nicolas Mattinen, Toronto: Traded twice in his junior career, Mattinen has gone from London to Flint and was sent to the Bulldogs earlier this season. A sixth-round pick of Toronto‰Ûªs in 2016, the towering 6-foot-5 defenceman isn‰Ûªt going to bring an overwhelming amount of offence, but he‰Ûªs grown as a player. In his draft year, Mattinen was a healthy scratch in the playoffs, but now he‰Ûªs a valued asset to the OHL champs. The Leafs have to sign him by the end of this season to his entry-level contract or he will go back into the draft.WHEN ARE THE GAMES?As noted above, the host Pats take on the OHL champion Hamilton Bulldogs on Friday, May 18 to open the tournament.If you‰Ûªre not familiar with the Memorial Cup format, here‰Ûªs how it works. Each of the four teams face each other once in a three-game round robin. Whichever team finishes in fourth place after that is eliminated. The second- and third-place teams then face off in a one-game semifinal, with the winner facing the first-place team in a winner-take-all game for the Memorial Cup.One game is played per day and the six round robin games run from May 18-23. Thursday, May 24 is set aside for a tiebreak game, should one be necessary to settle which team is knocked out of the first round. If no tiebreaker is required, that will be an off-day.The semifinal is Friday, May 25 at 8:00 p.m. MT and the championship is set for Sunday, May 27 at 5:00 p.m. MT. You can watch all the games on Sportsnet and Sportsnet NOW. (All times are from the Mountain Time Zone, two hours behind the East and one hour ahead of the Pacific.)OTHER PLAYERS OF INTERESTAlthough this isn‰Ûªt the deepest year in terms of players with ties to Canadian NHL teams, there are still players of note to keep an eye on.Three players from Canada‰Ûªs 2018 WJC gold medal team are in the tournament: Regina‰Ûªs Sam Steel (Anaheim), Hamilton‰Ûªs Robert Thomas (St. Louis) and Swift Current‰Ûªs Tyler Steenbergen (Arizona), each of whom are key scorers on their CHL teams. Thomas, in fact, was a member of the London Knights in 2015-16 when that team won both the OHL title and the Memorial Cup.Regina‰Ûªs Josh Mahura (Anaheim), the seventh-highest scoring blueliner in the WHL with 69 points in 60 games, was a close call for Team Canada. At first he was one of the last cuts, but when Dante Fabbro‰Ûªs availability was in question, Mahura was put back on the team and got into some pre-tournament games. But just before the tournament started Fabbro was cleared to play, which led to Mahura being sent home again. If you‰Ûªre looking for a player with a chip on his shoulder, Mahura is it.There are also some players with family ties to the NHL.Hamilton right-winger Isaac Nurse, once passed over in the NHL Draft already, is ranked 180th by Central Scouting among North American skaters for the 2018 draft. He is the cousin of Oilers defenceman Darnell Nurse, and scored 17 goals and 30 points in 68 games.Riley Stillman‰Ûªs dad, Cory, played 1,025 games and scored 727 points in his NHL career. Riley was a fourth-round pick of the Florida Panthers, one of his dad‰Ûªs former teams, and scored 21 points in 33 games with Hamilton after he was traded there from Oshawa.Sahvan Khaira is the brother of Oilers forward Jujhar Khaira. Sahvan is an undrafted 20-year-old defenceman playing for the Broncos, who will need to play a collapse and block style that focuses on defence to have success, as pointed out by our own Sam Cosentino.And finally there‰Ûªs Jake Leschyshyn, whose father Curtis played 1,033 games in his career as an NHL defenceman. Jake is a five-foot-11 centre for Regina, and he scored 40 points in 64 games for the Pats this season. He was a second-round pick of the Vegas Golden Knights last summer.WHO IS THE TOP 2018 NHL DRAFT ELIGIBLE PLAYER?The Memorial Cup isn‰Ûªt an event that usually features a lot of high-end draft eligibles, but there is one player this year who could end up going in the top 10.Titan defenceman Noah Dobson has seen his stock rise all season long. In Sportsnet‰Ûªs initial rankings in October he didn‰Ûªt crack the top 31. But by our November rankings he was positioned in 16th and being compared to 2017 draftee Miro Heiskanen, who similarly shot up lists all season before going third overall to Dallas. In our final rankings, released at the draft lottery, Dobson came in at seventh overall.A six-foot-3, 178-pound defenceman, Dobson has good size and room to fill out and excels with an all-around game. He scored 69 points in 67 QMJHL games this season to finish second in scoring at his position league-wide. He added 13 points in 20 playoff games.","The three championship Canadian Hockey League teams plus this year‰Ûªs host are set to drop the puck on the 2018 Mastercard Memorial Cup from Regina, Sask.Surprisingly, none of the three CHL leagues have their regular-season champions at this year‰Ûªs Memorial Cup.The Belleville Bulls last played for the Memorial Cup in 2008, but did not reach the final.Here are some reasons to tune in and watch the 2018 Memorial Cup from beginning to end, and where you can see the games.CANADIAN TEAM NHL PROSPECTS IN THE SPOTLIGHTTwo of the Canadian NHL teams don‰Ûªt have a player at the Memorial Cup.","['cup', 'great', 'storylines', 'mastercard', '2018', 'draft', 'season', 'games', 'prospects', 'teams', 'nhl', 'points', 'watch', 'team', 'memorial', 'game']",,,"['Rogers Digital Media', 'Rory Boylen', 'Sam Cosentino']",,https://www.sportsnet.ca/hockey/juniors/watch-2018-mastercard-memorial-cup-top-prospects-great-storylines/,,,,

Mastercard is ignoring flaw that allows hackers to spoof payments,"Vendors relying on Mastercard‰Ûªs Internet Gateway Service (MIGS) for processing online payments ought to double-check every transaction before they send out items to customers: There is a critical flaw in the system‰Ûªs validation protocol and it appears the company is completely ignoring it.Independent security researcher Yohanes Nugroho has stumbled upon a glaring flaw in the MIGS protocol that allows hackers to spoof the payment system and trick merchants into accepting invalid transactions as successful ‰ÛÒ without even knowing.‰ÛÏIt can be said that this is a MIGS client bug, but the hashing method chosen by Mastercard allows this to happen,‰Ûù the researcher explains. ‰ÛÏHad the value been encoded, this bug will not be possible.‰ÛùAccording to Nugroho‰Ûªs findings, crafty attackers can exploit this shortcoming to inject invalid values in third-party intermediate payment services to bypass Mastercard‰Ûªs system altogether and relay the request straight to vendors.As the researcher observed, ‰ÛÏinstead of validating inputs on the merchants server side before sending it to MIGS,‰Ûù the requests are only checked on the client side. Since this data never reaches Mastercard‰Ûªs servers, it remains susceptible to spoofing.This means that, if successful, hackers would be able to pass on invalid payment transactions as absolutely legitimate proof of payment. While merchants will still have to confirm the transaction, most users rarely ever check their bank accounts before approving the requests ‰ÛÒ which is exactly why this loophole is so worrisome.Nugroho has been able to confirm that at least one payment gateway ‰ÛÒ Fusion Payments, a company valued at $20 million ‰ÛÒ was susceptible to this attack.Fusion Payments has since rewarded the researcher with a $500 bug bounty. They have also already implemented a filtering measure to prevent attackers from exploiting this hole.This is what Nugroho said about Fusion‰Ûªs implementation of MIGS:Initially, they (Fusion) didn‰Ûªt even check the signature from MIGS. That means we can just alter the data returned by MIGS and mark the transaction as successful. This just means changing a single character from F (false) to 0 (success[ful]). So basically we can just enter any credit card number, got a failed response from MIGS, change it, and suddenly payment is successful. After they fixed the bug, I discovered that they are vulnerable to the Mastercard hashing bug.Redditors claim that hackers are already exploiting the vulnerability in India, where MIGS is relatively wide-used, but we haven‰Ûªt been able to confirm this is indeed the case.What is particularly worrying though is that the vulnerability can be exploited on practically any system reliant on MIGS, not just Fusion Payments. Still, Mastercard continues to ignore Nugroho‰Ûªs warnings.The researcher, who has previously reported and been rewarded $8,500 for finding a similar bug in the MIGS system, told TNW he reported the bug to Mastercard on August 17, but its representatives are yet to acknowledge the flaw. That is despite the fact that his password-protected disclosure post has been accessed by company employees at least three times so far.In addition to his bug report, he also emailed some of the Mastercard security officers that processed his previous disclosure. He never heard back from them either.We have contacted Mastercard for more details and will update this post accordingly should we hear back.Meanwhile, vendors, better stay on your toes ‰ÛÒ some seemingly valid payment requests might not be all that legitimate after all.Update: Mastercard‰Ûªs Senior Vice President of External Communications, Seth Eisen, had this to say:We are aware of and have looked into the claims made by this researcher. While this specific claim has does not exist within our system, we have identified a potential for a misconfiguration on merchants‰Ûª sites that could potentially affect how data is delivered. We are providing specific training and resources to the small number of merchants who could be impacted to minimize any exploitation of such an action.Read next: Kroger to use Uber drivers and online ordering to compete with Amazon","Independent security researcher Yohanes Nugroho has stumbled upon a glaring flaw in the MIGS protocol that allows hackers to spoof the payment system and trick merchants into accepting invalid transactions as successful ‰ÛÒ without even knowing.‰ÛÏIt can be said that this is a MIGS client bug, but the hashing method chosen by Mastercard allows this to happen,‰Ûù the researcher explains.This means that, if successful, hackers would be able to pass on invalid payment transactions as absolutely legitimate proof of payment.After they fixed the bug, I discovered that they are vulnerable to the Mastercard hashing bug.In addition to his bug report, he also emailed some of the Mastercard security officers that processed his previous disclosure.","['spoof', 'successful', 'mastercard', 'bug', 'flaw', 'payments', 'system', 'researcher', 'mastercards', 'migs', 'ignoring', 'hackers', 'merchants', 'allows', 'payment']",,,[],9/6/17 0:00,https://thenextweb.com/security/2017/09/06/mastercard/,,,,
Mastercard taps into the millennial market,"Mastercard has set its sights on millennials.Martina Hund-Mejean, Mastercard Inc.‰Ûªs MA, -0.39% chief financial officer, says the company is positioning itself to take advantage of a shift toward greater use of credit cards by millennials as they become more confident about managing credit and debt.The number of credit cards held by millennials in the U.S. amounted to an average of just over two per person in 2016, up 52% from 2010, according to Experian PLC, EXPN, -0.29% with an average balance per person of $3,542, up 32% from 2010. Grabbing as big a slice as possible of that growing market would help Mastercard compete with Visa Inc. V, -0.46% in the overall credit-card market, where Visa captured 53% of purchases in the U.S. in the first half of this year, compared with 22% for Mastercard, according to the Nilson Report, a trade publication.In an interview with The Wall Street Journal, Hund-Mejean discussed Mastercard‰Ûªs efforts to attract the next generation of credit-card users around the world. Edited excerpts follow.From insight to productWSJ: What are some of the consumer insights you‰Ûªve learned recently about millennial behavior?Hund-Mejean: During and after the financial crisis, millennials were seeing how tough it actually was for their parents to be paying back the credit they got extended by providers and by banks. A lot of the millennials started using only debit-card kind of products because they thought they knew they could be doing their household budgeting in a better way without falling into the trap their parents fell into.Well, lo and behold, as the millennials are maturing over the last two, three, four years, we‰Ûªre starting to see a changed behavior. They‰Ûªre starting to feel much more comfortable in terms of their own budgeting discipline. They learned it through what they‰Ûªre doing with their checking account and their debit account.Everybody thought millennials are interested only in debit. They‰Ûªre actually growing into the credit-card space.How is Mastercard using that information in its business?Hund-Mejean: We know from research that millennials want to have more discipline when it comes to money management and want more control over spending. They also love to travel, see the world and have a memorable experience; they would probably enjoy travel-related rewards. They are concerned about digital security, and a good user experience is what they are looking for.So, based on these insights, we enhanced our World Elite credit-card platform in the U.S. Instead of a ready-made, one-size-fits-all rewards program, our benefits optimizer provides cardholders a single online touchpoint for rewards management. People can track and manage multiple Mastercard accounts. From there they have the flexibility to access and activate their benefits, even selecting new ones. Pay With Rewards, a mobile app where consumers can set up when and where to redeem points automatically at the time of transaction, was developed from research that showed us that millennials want instant digital-redemption options.Ease and safetyAre millennials particularly interested in mobile and seamless ways to pay?Hund-Mejean: Digital and physical are moving together, it‰Ûªs completely converging. When you think about consumers, what they really like to do, they don‰Ûªt care if they‰Ûªre in a store or on a website, they want to pay the same way. Millennials and even centennials [those born after millennials] are no different in this respect. Where they‰Ûªre different from my generation is that they have been born into this technology-driven world. They have a mobile way of life.So, in a mobile-first life, they expect to engage, interact and transact with friends, family, brands and even their money digitally. And they want to do so in simple and safe ways. That‰Ûªs where technologies like biometrics are coming into play. Some of our internal research has found that nearly 60% of millennials in the U.S. would like to be able to make payments by scanning their smartphone.Mobile payments have grown significantly, but usage is still relatively small. Mastercard has invested in various ways of making payments, including wearables that can be used for payments and an app that works with smart refrigerators to pay for the items they order. Why do that now?Hund-Mejean: You need to think of this as a marathon, not a sprint. Plastic cards have been around for 50 years. People know how to use them, and merchants know how to accept them. So, that acceptance grows faster and easier.For mobile payments, we‰Ûªre building on what we‰Ûªve learned. But think of it almost as the chicken and the egg. Merchants begin to accept mobile payments when there‰Ûªs enough pull from consumers for that. Consumers also tend to pick up mobile payments when there‰Ûªs enough acceptance for them. And then eventually the whole thing is picking up steam.As millennials have grown up, they‰Ûªve also seen many examples of data breaches and incidents of fraud online. It wasn‰Ûªt that long ago that companies including Mastercard began to require a switch from traditional credit cards that have a magnetic stripe to Europay-Mastercard-Visa, or EMV cards, which have added security features including a chip. Despite those upgrades, we still see cases of fraud. How is Mastercard moving forward to secure transactions?Hund-Mejean: In terms of EMV, which is only a small subchapter of fraud, everywhere EMV is rolled out, fraud has declined in a very significant way, even in the U.S.Where the fraud has increased for the U.S. is online. And that is because EMV is only in the physical space.But chip-card technology is serving as a base for securing the online world as well, [by enabling the creation of] a unique code for every purchase. If that code appears more than once, the transaction would be red-flagged as fraudulent.To keep online payments secure, you‰Ûªve also invested in tokenization, which allows consumers to make payments without vendors having the ability to store cardholders‰Ûª account information. Instead, the vendors receive a unique series of numbers‰ÛÓa ‰ÛÏtoken‰Ûù‰ÛÓthat is used to validate the customer‰Ûªs identity. Is tokenization enough when it comes to preventing online fraud?Hund-Mejean: Tokens are creating a safer way to send data electronically, and our work in biometrics‰ÛÓwhat some people refer to as selfie pay‰ÛÓis helping to drive greater verification of the cardholder‰Ûªs identity.If you were to think about fraud traditionally, think of a balloon. You could squeeze or reduce the air in one part, and it would flow to another part. That‰Ûªs what you‰Ûªve seen as new technologies are introduced in-store or online. What we‰Ûªre working on now is to not just move that air, or fraud, around, but to reduce and eliminate it through a multilayered strategy. And our security development over the years and recent acquisitions speak to that.What are some of those acquisitions? What else are you doing to reduce fraud?Hund-Mejean: We‰Ûªre heavily investing to make sure we get to the next areas of where we can keep you safe. Some of the areas are biometrics. Now you‰Ûªre using your thumbprint. Mastercard did selfie pay, which is facial recognition, which gets a lot more points in terms of recognizing you than a thumbprint. That might be the safer thing.Currently, people identify themselves online with passwords and security questions, but these are neither secure, because they‰Ûªre easily stolen or socially engineered, nor easy to use, because they are often forgotten, there are too many of them. Mastercard Identity Check Mobile eliminates the need for cardholders to recall passwords, dramatically speeding up the digital checkout experience while also improving security. Instead, the cardholder can verify their identity by using the fingerprint scanner on their smartphone or via facial-recognition technology by taking a selfie photo.Just recently [in March], one of my favorites, we bought a company called NuData. They recognize you depending on how you hold your iPhone and what you actually do in terms of typing in your password, at which speed you‰Ûªre typing in your password, and what else you‰Ûªre doing on the phone. So there‰Ûªs a lot of data and a lot of artificial intelligence behind it that NuData uses.No end for cashVisa recently offered $10,000 each to as many as 50 restaurants and food vendors who were willing to stop accepting cash. What do you think about efforts to go cashless?Hund-Mejean: I believe for decades we‰Ûªll still be having cash. We probably will always have cash.Even though one of our vision statements is ‰ÛÏa world beyond cash,‰Ûù there will always be cash in countries for certain things. People will feel more comfortable with cash. I come from Germany. You will not get rid of cash in Germany. The grandmother will want to give a bill to her 10-year-old grandson and not have the parents know about it.","Mobile payments have grown significantly, but usage is still relatively small.Merchants begin to accept mobile payments when there‰Ûªs enough pull from consumers for that.Consumers also tend to pick up mobile payments when there‰Ûªs enough acceptance for them.But chip-card technology is serving as a base for securing the online world as well, [by enabling the creation of] a unique code for every purchase.To keep online payments secure, you‰Ûªve also invested in tokenization, which allows consumers to make payments without vendors having the ability to store cardholders‰Ûª account information.","['cash', 'market', 'think', 'taps', 'world', 'payments', 'millennial', 'mobile', 'fraud', 'theyre', 'millennials', 'mastercard', 'online']",,,['Maria Lamagna'],8/25/17 0:00,https://www.marketwatch.com/story/mastercard-taps-into-the-millennial-market-2017-08-25,,,,
Mastercard Memorial Cup Preview: A key to victory for each team,"The Regina Pats and Hamilton Bulldogs will drop the puck on the 100th Mastercard Memorial Cup Friday night and, by next weekend, we‰Ûªll have crowned a new CHL champion.But there is a lot of hockey to be played between now and then and all four teams have a very real shot to win it all. In the lead up to the tournament, we‰Ûªve given you a strength and weakness for each team, one strategy each team needs to employ and a player to watch on each of the four participants.Today we look at one key to success for each of Regina, Hamilton, Swift Current and Acadie-Bathurst.Hamilton ‰ÛÓ Climb the Mountain Again: Inevitably, there‰Ûªs one team every year that comes into this event so happy to have won a league title that it‰Ûªs hard to regenerate the same passion and energy to win another title. Hamilton is most susceptible to this in 2018, after knocking off the CHL‰Ûªs top team, the Sault Ste. Marie Greyhounds, in the league final. Based on the talent and depth inequality between the two OHL conferences, the Bulldogs were underdogs but found a way to defeat the Hounds in Game 6 on home ice to set off a celebration not seen in that town since the Lemieux-Gretzky goal at the 1987 Canada Cup. Hamilton should not take the Pats lightly simply because they lost in Round 1.Regina ‰ÛÓ Win Game 1: There is no better way for the Pats to shed the lame-host moniker than by winning on opening night. A victory against de facto favourite Hamilton would immediately restore confidence into the Pats and their fan base. A win on opening night would also guarantee at least one game beyond the three round-robin games, whether it‰Ûªs a semifinal or tie-breaker, and that immediately puts you in the mix to win the whole thing. The Pats will have to channel their emotions early as the crowd is sure to be fired up. The players will be nervous for not having played since April 2, and getting up to game speed against a fast and heavy Hamilton team will be a challenge.Acadie-Bathurst ‰ÛÓ Overcoming the Time Change: Three time zones worth of travel is normally the kiss of death. Think about two powerhouse teams that played in Windsor at the Memorial Cup last year: the Seattle Thunderbirds and Saint John Sea Dogs. Both teams failed to resemble the level they played at when they won their respective league titles. The Titan actually did themselves a favour by winning in six games as Game 7 was scheduled for Tuesday night, which would have left no time between winning, packing and leaving to get to Regina and settle. The Titan does have the benefit of playing its first game on Saturday, although it‰Ûªs a 2:00 p.m. local start, which is essentially 11:00 a.m. in Bathurst. Of the past 14 teams that had to travel three time zones to the Memorial Cup, only two ended up winning. The last to do it was the 2013 Halifax Mooseheads, which featured the likes of Nathan MacKinnon, Jonathan Drouin and Zach Fucale.Swift Current ‰ÛÓ Mojo: There‰Ûªs something fascinating about the smallest CHL market earning a berth in the 2018 Memorial Cup. Oddly, the Broncos are also the last Saskatchewan-based team to win the Ed Chynoweth Cup, all the way back in 1993. In 1986 the Swift Current Broncos were involved in a bus crash that killed four members of their team. That same year, the Humboldt Broncos went on to win the SJHL title. The Humboldt Broncos lost 16 members of their team in an April 6, 2018 bus crash and, one month and one week later, the Swift Current Broncos captured the WHL title. If you believe in divine intervention, there may be one more title left for Swift Current to capture. Not to mention, it would be nice if this generation of Broncos fans could actually celebrate and embrace a Memorial Cup win, something they haven‰Ûªt reconciled since the franchise‰Ûªs last Cup win in 1989.","The Regina Pats and Hamilton Bulldogs will drop the puck on the 100th Mastercard Memorial Cup Friday night and, by next weekend, we‰Ûªll have crowned a new CHL champion.Think about two powerhouse teams that played in Windsor at the Memorial Cup last year: the Seattle Thunderbirds and Saint John Sea Dogs.Of the past 14 teams that had to travel three time zones to the Memorial Cup, only two ended up winning.Swift Current ‰ÛÓ Mojo: There‰Ûªs something fascinating about the smallest CHL market earning a berth in the 2018 Memorial Cup.Not to mention, it would be nice if this generation of Broncos fans could actually celebrate and embrace a Memorial Cup win, something they haven‰Ûªt reconciled since the franchise‰Ûªs last Cup win in 1989.","['cup', 'current', 'key', 'mastercard', 'win', 'hamilton', 'preview', 'title', 'victory', 'broncos', 'team', 'memorial', 'pats', 'game']",,,"['Rogers Digital Media', 'Sam Cosentino']",,https://www.sportsnet.ca/hockey/juniors/mastercard-memorial-cup-preview-key-victory-team/,,,,
Cryptocurrency Investments Boost Mastercard,"Credit cards and cryptos might be a match well made.In its latest quarterly report, Mastercard showed strength in cross-border volumes, up double digits at 22 percent. One point of that growth was buoyed ‰ÛÓ at least in part ‰ÛÓ by cardholders buying cryptocurrencies with their payment cards, Bloomberg reported.Of course, what goes up must come down.In a recent conference call with analysts discussing results, Mastercard CFO Martina Hund-Mejean said clients were spending on cryptos, and also on traveling in Europe.‰ÛÏWe don‰Ûªt really plan on any of this continuing in any big way,‰Ûù Hund-Mejean said, commenting on the crypto-focused side of spending. ‰ÛÏJust last week ‰ÛÓ as some of the prices came down ‰ÛÓ you already saw the trend slowing.‰ÛùAt the same time, Mastercard has undertaken a limited program through which crypto firms are able to offer the payment processing company‰Ûªs branded prepaid debit card.‰ÛÏWe should always look at every new area and that‰Ûªs what we‰Ûªre doing, but it‰Ûªs more in a very small, extremely controlled pilot phase,‰Ûù Hund-Mejean said, with an eye on the consumer ‰ÛÏrather than having them stomach some of this unbelievable volatility that‰Ûªs going on in cryptocurrency values.‰ÛùThat volatility has led some issuers to curb their customers‰Ûª ability to buy into those digital currencies, possibly dragging on Mastercard‰Ûªs cross-border trends.

"IFC, Mastercard Foundation extend financial inclusion for millions in Africa","International Finance Corperation (IFC), together with the Mastercard Foundation, today released a new report documenting the transformation underway in financial inclusion in Sub-Saharan Africa.The findings are based on lessons learned from joint projects that have resulted in access to new digital financial services for more than seven million users on the continent over the past six years.The report, ‰Û÷Digital Access: The Future of Financial Inclusion‰Ûª highlights the phenomenal success of digital financial services in Sub-Saharan Africa and outlines the challenges still to be tackled to reach universal financial access.It captures the experience and knowledge gained by IFC and the Mastercard Foundation in supporting the growth of digital finance in Africa under the joint Partnership for Financial Inclusion since 2012.Working together with 14 microfinance institutions, banks, mobile network operators, and payments service providers across the continent, the joint initiative has resulted in 7.2 million new digital financial services users (a 250 percent increase from the baseline), 45,000 new banking agents, and $300 million in monthly transactions.‰ÛÏFinancial inclusion is one of Africa‰Ûªs great success stories of this decade. Mobile money solutions and agent banking now offer affordable, instant, and reliable transactions, savings, credit, and even insurance opportunities in rural villages and urban neighborhoods where no bank had ever established a branch,‰Ûù noted IFC‰Ûªs Chief Executive Officer Philippe Le Houerou and Mastercard Foundation President and Chief Executive Officer Reeta Roy in a joint foreword to the new report.Financial inclusion in Sub-Saharan Africa has increased dramatically over the past decade, from 23 percent in 2011 to 43 percent in 2017, according to recently released data from the World Bank Findexsurvey. Sub-Saharan Africa is the only region where the share of adults with a mobile money account exceeds 10 percent.‰ÛÏThe Partnership for Financial Inclusion has been an important actor in helping to drive financial inclusion in Africa,‰Ûù said Ruth Dueck-Mbeba, Senior Program Manager at the Mastercard Foundation. ‰ÛÏWe‰Ûªre proud of the work that our partner, IFC, has led over the past six years.It has enabled millions of people to benefit from access to financial services. More than that, the knowledge that we‰Ûªve gained will lead to millions more people improving their lives and their communities by being able to join the formal financial services sector.‰ÛùThere is an emerging body of evidence on the impact that digital financial inclusion can have on inclusive economic growth and development.A study in the report shows that smallholder cocoa farmers in CÌ«te d‰ÛªIvoire who saved regularly were better able to feed their families than those who did not save, irrespective of the farmers‰Ûª annual income.The same study also revealed that many smallholder cocoa farmers felt ‰Û÷socially excluded‰Ûª by traditional banks but were generally accepting of agent banking and digital services.Mamie Kalonda, Chief Executive Officer of FINCA in the Democratic Republic of Congo, one of the client institutions of the Partnership for Financial Inclusion, said, ‰ÛÏIn the DRC, I expect digital financial services will grow even faster in the next five years. Almost all banks are going mobile.‰Ûù She added, ‰ÛÏIt is important to reach the rural areas, because that is where people are poor.‰ÛùIn the DRC, the use of mobile money services had reached 16 percent in 2017, helping to push the overall financial inclusion rate from 3.7 percent to 26 percent in the same period.Riadh Naouar, Head of IFC‰Ûªs Financial Institutions Group Advisory in Sub-Saharan Africa, said, ‰ÛÏLooking ahead, we can see some interesting trends for the future. While East Africa has long been the star performer in terms of the evolution of digital financial services, West Africa is the new growth market. Not only in terms of reach, but also for innovation.‰Ûù‰ÛÏThere is a need in the broader industry across the continent to shift to the next generation of digital products,‰Ûù he added.‰ÛÏA broader, more multi-faceted market is asking for more sophisticated and relevant products beyond person-to-person payments. There are evident opportunities to develop digital banking, savings and credit products, as well as the digitization of value chain financing and merchant payments.‰ÛùThe report noted some of the challenges that will have to be addressed to continue progress in financial inclusion. For instance, to expand financial services to the last mile will require investments in merchant and agent networks, and innovation along agricultural value chains. As well, financial service providers will need to develop and launch products that meet an increasingly nuanced demand from an even broader variety of users, such as entrepreneurs, merchants, smallholder farmers, youth and women.For more information, please watch our videos on joint IFC and Mastercard Foundation projects in Cote d‰ÛªIvoire, Madagascar and Zambia.About the Partnership for Financial InclusionThe Partnership for Financial Inclusion is a $37.4 million joint initiative of IFC and the Mastercard Foundation to expand microfinance and advance digital financial services in Sub-Saharan Africa.It is also supported by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and the Development Bank of Austria, OeEB.","International Finance Corperation (IFC), together with the Mastercard Foundation, today released a new report documenting the transformation underway in financial inclusion in Sub-Saharan Africa.The report, ‰Û÷Digital Access: The Future of Financial Inclusion‰Ûª highlights the phenomenal success of digital financial services in Sub-Saharan Africa and outlines the challenges still to be tackled to reach universal financial access.It captures the experience and knowledge gained by IFC and the Mastercard Foundation in supporting the growth of digital finance in Africa under the joint Partnership for Financial Inclusion since 2012.‰ÛÏThe Partnership for Financial Inclusion has been an important actor in helping to drive financial inclusion in Africa,‰Ûù said Ruth Dueck-Mbeba, Senior Program Manager at the Mastercard Foundation.About the Partnership for Financial InclusionThe Partnership for Financial Inclusion is a $37.4 million joint initiative of IFC and the Mastercard Foundation to expand microfinance and advance digital financial services in Sub-Saharan Africa.","['joint', 'digital', 'services', 'millions', 'financial', 'ifc', 'inclusion', 'africa', 'partnership', 'subsaharan', 'extend', 'mastercard', 'foundation']",,,[],5/16/18 0:00,https://www.myjoyonline.com/business/2018/may-16th/ifc-mastercard-foundation-extend-financial-inclusion-for-millions-in-africa.php,,,,

The company‰Ûªs 3-months average volume stands at 4.04 million. When we divide the last trade volume by the 3-month average volume, we found out a relative volume of 0.63. The total dollar value of all 1.03 billion outstanding shares is 197.9 billion.ATR value of company was 3.68. Average True Range (ATR) is an indicator based on trading ranges smoothed by an N-period exponential moving average percentage of the true range values. ATR can display volatility of stocks, ETFs and indexes. The principal of ATR is very similar to other volatility indicators: A high ATR value signals a possible trend change. A low ATR value correlates with a weaker trend movement.The PE ratio of 40.11 helps investors explore how much they should pay for a stock based on its current earnings. High ratio reveals positive future performance and investors are willing to pay more. Low ratio discloses poor current and future performance. The beta factor is 1.19.Volatility shows sense of how far the stock will fall if the market takes a dive and how high stock will rise if the bull starts to climb. A stock with a beta more than 1 means high volatile and less than 1 means low volatile.Currently Analysts have a mean recommendation of 1.70 on the shares.

Shorter moving average timeframes are more sensitive to price fluctuations and can pick up on trend changes more quickly than longer-term moving averages. However, these more frequent signals may also result in more ‰ÛÏwhipsaws‰Ûù, resulting in erroneous trade signals. Mastercard Incorporated (MA) recently closed with rise of 5.60% to its 20-Day Simple Moving Average. This short time frame picture represents an upward movement of current price over average price of last 20 days. Now moving toward intermediate time frame, 50-day Moving average is more useful at showing position trading trends lasting 50 days. Shares of MA moved upward with change of 7.51% to its 50-day Moving average. This rising movement shows positive prices direction over last 50 days.Finally observing long term time frame, 200-day simple moving average is more helpful at telling general investing trends lasting 200 days. Longer moving average timeframes are less sensitive to price fluctuations than shorter term timeframes and will generate far few signals. This will reduce the number of ‰ÛÏwhipsaws‰Ûù, which is good, but will also generate signals later than when using shorter term averages. MA stock price revealed optimistic move of 22.54% comparing average price of last 200 days. This comparison showed up direction of price above its 200-SMA.Traders will often use multiple moving averages to analyze a single security. Moving averages are a very simple tool to use, like most technical indicators, different traders will focus on different ways to use them.

Cryptocurrency Project Eyes Revamping Visa/MasterCard Payments,"CHARLESTOWN, St. Kitts and Nevis, May 7, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Modern Finance Chain is creating a sustainable cryptocurrency ecosystem. One that counteracts the payment system problems associated with traditional merchant-consumer payment transactions, drives cryptocurrency adoption and provides other cryptocurrency projects immediate integration into commerce.""The problem with Visa/Mastercard and even American Express & Eurocard are that the merchant has no control over the transaction - it's entirely up to the credit card companies to complete the transaction and decide if the merchant will receive funds or not."" - Vic Shybaiev, Modern Finance ChainThe ProblemDigital currencies have achieved phenomenal growth in recent years. Cryptocurrency enthusiasts and investors alike have obtained massive wealth in the booming crypto market. Yet because of slow merchant adoption, it still remains fairly inconvenient to pay for goods and services with cryptocurrencies. Additionally, current blockchain projects are isolated and promote innovation only within their own technologies and community. MF Chain has a mission to break down the common barriers of all cryptocurrencies to create a collaborative digital economy that embraces any host of innovation.The SolutionMF Chain is building the most cost-effective cryptocurrency payment ecosystem that rewards the consumer as well as the merchant. MF Chain's immediate goal is to become the foundation of commerce powered by the blockchain by bringing users the ability to transact using their favorite coins, based on a zero-fee model along with an innovative merchant rewards program.The greater vision of Modern Finance Chain is the MF Mainnet. An independent public blockchain that uses a BFT/POS consensus model and a unique master node incentivization protocol. Furthermore, MF Mainnet will allow for the development of enterprise level private blockchains, atomic swap cross-chain transactions, multi-blockchain integration, and a verified digital identity system. Long-term value for Modern Finance Chain will be realized with the Innovation Incubator. Providing upstart projects the resources required to be successful along with a multi-currency ICO Platform that will allow multiple currencies to be accepted during the live token generation event.Fundamentally, Modern Finance Chain's goal is to expand cryptocurrency utility to the point of ubiquity. We are helping cryptocurrency reach beyond being merely an investment, trading or speculative tool. Consumers, merchants, and enterprises both large and small will now be able to capitalize on the convenience and security that cryptocurrency and blockchain provide.Contact:Raj DineroModern Finance Chaininfo@mfchain.comhttps://mfchain.comRelated LinksCompany WebsiteRelated Videohttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVnwjRmYNLsView original content with multimedia:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/cryptocurrency-project-eyes-revamping-visamastercard-payments-300643648.htmlSOURCE Modern Finance ChainRelated Linkshttps://mfchain.com","CHARLESTOWN, St. Kitts and Nevis, May 7, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Modern Finance Chain is creating a sustainable cryptocurrency ecosystem.One that counteracts the payment system problems associated with traditional merchant-consumer payment transactions, drives cryptocurrency adoption and provides other cryptocurrency projects immediate integration into commerce.The SolutionMF Chain is building the most cost-effective cryptocurrency payment ecosystem that rewards the consumer as well as the merchant.Long-term value for Modern Finance Chain will be realized with the Innovation Incubator.Contact:Raj DineroModern Finance Chaininfo@mfchain.comhttps://mfchain.comRelated LinksCompany WebsiteRelated Videohttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVnwjRmYNLsView original content with multimedia:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/cryptocurrency-project-eyes-revamping-visamastercard-payments-300643648.htmlSOURCE Modern Finance ChainRelated Linkshttps://mfchain.com","['cryptocurrency', 'modern', 'blockchain', 'project', 'payments', 'transactions', 'revamping', 'visamastercard', 'finance', 'projects', 'chain', 'merchant', 'payment', 'eyes', 'mf']",,,['Modern Finance Chain'],,https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/cryptocurrency-project-eyes-revamping-visamastercard-payments-300643648.html,,,,
What's the economic impact of Blues Fest or Jazz Fest? Chicago will now get data from Mastercard spending,"Which has the greater importance to Chicago: The Chicago Blues Festival or the Chicago Jazz Festival?If you love our city‰Ûªs musical heritage, you‰Ûªd rightly answer ‰ÛÏboth.‰Ûù But what about the economic impact of these big downtown festivals, both now held in Millennium Park? Which is the bigger deal? And was it really a good idea to move them from Grant Park to Millennium Park?And is Taste of Chicago really worth all the security and clean-up hassles in cold, hard dollars?Until now, the only honest answer to any of those questions has been: no good data and no real clue.Or, as Mark Kelly, commissioner of the Department of Cultural Affairs and Special Events, told me: ‰ÛÏAs I speak to you now, I have no real idea of who is the audience for any of these festivals, where they are from, or how they are spending their dollars.‰ÛùBut, the Tribune has learned, that‰Ûªs all about to change.Beginning with the Blues Festival next month, Kelly and other city honchos will have access to some rich new data: the actual credit card spending by attendees.Chicago and London are the sites of pilot programs involving the Chicago-based City Tech Collaborative, Mastercard and Microsoft. For the first time anywhere on this scale, Mastercard will track, and then reveal, who spends what where in the vicinity of the festival.So if festival-goers walk out of the Blues Festival into, say, a nearby gastropub for a late-night libation, and they use their Mastercard, data on the consequent uptick in spending at nearby restaurants will be aggregated and reported. The data will, of course, be anonymized, but the city still will know whether you are an international or a domestic cardholder. And by looking at aggregated spending data from hotels, it should also be able to estimate how many attendees spent the night in the city.Here‰Ûªs what‰Ûªs radical about this idea: Economic-impact studies have long been conducted by cultural organizations eager to make the case that their very presence propels other spending: a ‰ÛÏHamilton‰Ûù-goer, for example, might park a car or have dinner at the Dearborn or walk into Nordstrom Rack before the show. These studies are often used to argue for tax breaks, public subsidy or, more generally, that the arts are a great investment for urban downtowns.That central argument is irrefutable in general, but the specifics can be problematic. The studies invariably are commissioned by those with a vested interest. And the data is typically anecdotal and otherwise squishy. Unsurprisingly, the studies are usually released to the media with hyperbolic headlines. And, too often, duly reported in the same way.Take, for example, the recent economic impact survey commissioned by the Chicago Loop Alliance, a membership organization promoting business interests in the Loop, including cultural organizations, and thus a group with a vested interest in concluding that there is a whole lot of economic impact.That was the conclusion. Surprise!‰ÛÏIn total,‰Ûù the study read, ‰ÛÏthe Arts in the Loop are responsible for $2.2 billion in economic impact to the Loop and Chicago each year. This includes $1.4 billion from institutions, $600 million from their visitors and $250 million from visitors to public art, who spend their money on meals, retail and transportation. Annually, from these collective impacts, the Arts in the Loop are responsible for driving $113.5 million in Loop restaurant revenue, $81.3 million in Loop real estate revenue, $78 million in hotel revenue, $63 million in Loop retail sales, $43 million in transportation and parking revenue and $40 million in tax revenue ($34 million for the state of Illinois and $6 million for the city of Chicago).‰ÛùPhew! The data for institutional spending by groups and their employees mostly came from their IRS Form 990s, but what about that $850 million on ‰ÛÏmeals, retail and transportation‰Ûù? Organizations could accurately report their own ticket sales as part of that impact, but how did they know what people spent elsewhere?The answer was, in large part, surveys. A sample of attendees ‰ÛÓ some 12,000 in this case ‰ÛÓ filled in online surveys and the results were extrapolated.But were people telling the truth about what they spent and where? Were certain kinds of people more likely to respond? Would you equally likely to fill out a survey if your spending was minimal or you went straight home?Who knows? I‰Ûªve no reason to undermine the accuracy of the Loop Alliance report. But, as Brenna Berman, executive director of City Tech, said to me this week: ‰ÛÏYour credit card spending does not lie.‰ÛùIndeed not, try claiming that it does when they ask you to pay your bill.The city is getting this new data without having to pay for it, although Berman said that Microsoft and Mastercard are developing a product they eventually plan to sell. The plan raises the question as to what happens to the people using Visa, but Berman pointed out that statistical models are available to account for that. And, in all probability, what people are verifiably doing with their Mastercards, they‰Ûªre also doing with their Visas.Both Berman and Kelly said that if this turns out to be the rare economic impact study that reveals a disappointing level of impact, then they will treat this not as bad news, but as, in Berman‰Ûªs words, ‰ÛÏan actionable piece of information.‰Ûù They might move a location, adjust a timing, change what is sold at the concession stands or whatever the data shows.What about Lollapalooza? Where does that fit in? Well, that‰Ûªs a for-profit entity with a vested interest in keeping people spending on-site. They link credit cards with wristbands at the festival, which means they have a lot of data too. But they don‰Ûªt want you at the bar across the street. They want you to stay and spend with them. And they are not inclined to share that proprietary stuff with the city.City officials ‰ÛÓ and city festivals ‰ÛÓ should have different priorities. They are about the good of the whole: the hard-working wait staff at the bars in the Loop as well as the hotel owners and tourism promoters. They should be all about getting people off-site and spending across a diverse array of mostly local businesses. This is one of the obligations of elected civic officials.And it‰Ûªs why the recent announcement of the new entertainment venues at Sterling Bay‰Ûªs planned Lincoln Yard development raises a lot of complex issues. There needs to be some hard questions asked about how this will benefit the city as a whole. Will these Live Nation-run venues remove economic impact from the Loop and existing local businesses? Will they do good or harm to the urban fabric?","Which has the greater importance to Chicago: The Chicago Blues Festival or the Chicago Jazz Festival?If you love our city‰Ûªs musical heritage, you‰Ûªd rightly answer ‰ÛÏboth.‰Ûù But what about the economic impact of these big downtown festivals, both now held in Millennium Park?And by looking at aggregated spending data from hotels, it should also be able to estimate how many attendees spent the night in the city.‰ÛÏIn total,‰Ûù the study read, ‰ÛÏthe Arts in the Loop are responsible for $2.2 billion in economic impact to the Loop and Chicago each year.Will these Live Nation-run venues remove economic impact from the Loop and existing local businesses?","['loop', 'blues', 'studies', 'chicago', 'whats', 'data', 'million', 'city', 'spending', 'economic', 'jazz', 'revenue', 'fest', 'mastercard', 'impact']",,,['Chris Jones'],5/18/18 5:00,http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/theater/ct-ae-city-fests-economic-impact-jones-0520-story.html,,,,

Upstarts Are Swiping Business From Visa and Mastercard in India,"Global card companies like Visa Inc. and Mastercard Inc. are losing market share to upstarts in the world‰Ûªs most innovative payments market: India.Transactions through India‰Ûªs homegrown Unified Payments Interface -- which allows mobile apps run by retailers, airlines and other firms to take payment directly from bank accounts -- reached almost half the value of debit and credit cards swiped at stores last month, central bank data show.The surge in UPI transactions has taken place since 2016 when the interface was set up by an umbrella organization of Indian banks. Mastercard, in contrast, has built up its business in India over three decades.Game On Homegrown UPI is increasing market share against entrenched competition Source: Reserve Bank of India‰ÛÏThe introduction of UPI in August 2016 led to the creation of a wealth of new innovative payment solutions, and the adoption rates of UPI payments are truly spectacular,‰Ûù U.S.-based Fidelity National Information Services Inc. said in a December 2017 report. UPI ‰ÛÏopens up access to real-time by allowing payments to be directly integrated into external business applications,‰Ûù it said.India‰Ûªs payments system was alone among more than 40 countries tracked by Fidelity National to gain a top score of five for innovation and customer value. China‰Ûªs Internet Banking Payment System scored two and Kenya‰Ûªs PesaLink scored four. Criteria included round-the-clock availability, speed of settlement, and level of government or regulator support.Big Boom The world's big tech firms are getting into India's payments market Source: Credit SuisseAmazon.com Inc. and Jet Airways India Ltd. -- the nation‰Ûªs second-biggest airline by passengers -- are among firms that have integrated UPI into their apps in order to take payment from customers. Ola, a local rival to Uber Technologies Inc., Big Bazaar, a chain of stores run by billionaire Kishore Biyani, and incumbent mobile wallet leader Paytm Mobile Solutions Pvt. are other users.Facebook Inc. is piloting a payments service in India with a UPI backbone for its WhatsApp Pay, which has already drawn comparisons with the way WeChat reshaped payments in China.Read: WhatsApp Stirs Up India With Push Into Digital Payments‰ÛÏPayment integration into popular apps in India will drive the digital payments market to $1 trillion over the next five years,"" Credit Suisse Group AG said in a report last month. ‰ÛÏWith 800 million bank accounts now linked, the bulk is mobile-transaction ready.‰ÛùCurrently, India‰Ûªs payments market is worth less than $200 billion, dwarfed by China‰Ûªs $27 trillion market that‰Ûªs now opening up to global players.Road to $1 Trillion Credit Suisse says mobile transactions will lead India's digital payments boom Source: Credit SuisseOne challenge in India is the dominance of cash, which accounts for some 70 percent of the country‰Ûªs total transactions by value. However, China transitioned to digital on the back of rising mobile and data penetration, and that process was hastened by e-commerce and social platforms, according to Credit Suisse. The same shift may play out in India, where data usage for 300 million Indian smartphone users rose to 5-10 GB a month from 1GB last year.Advances in India‰Ûªs digital payments market picked up pace after Prime Minister Narendra Modi‰Ûªs shock decision to invalidate 86 percent of the country‰Ûªs currency in circulation. The number of UPI transactions have surged almost 57,000 percent since November 2016, while that of debit and credit cards has risen 20 percent.‰ÛÏWhile the effects of the demonetization event of November 2016 are now waning, it would be safe to conclude that the event has caused a permanent uplift in the share of non-cash transactions in the economy,‰Ûù said Credit Suisse.‰ÛÓ With assistance by Peter Vercoe","Global card companies like Visa Inc. and Mastercard Inc. are losing market share to upstarts in the world‰Ûªs most innovative payments market: India.The surge in UPI transactions has taken place since 2016 when the interface was set up by an umbrella organization of Indian banks.Mastercard, in contrast, has built up its business in India over three decades.India‰Ûªs payments system was alone among more than 40 countries tracked by Fidelity National to gain a top score of five for innovation and customer value.Advances in India‰Ûªs digital payments market picked up pace after Prime Minister Narendra Modi‰Ûªs shock decision to invalidate 86 percent of the country‰Ûªs currency in circulation.","['india', 'visa', 'business', 'market', 'upi', 'digital', 'suisse', 'payments', 'upstarts', 'transactions', 'indias', 'mobile', 'swiping', 'credit', 'mastercard']",,,['Jeanette Rodrigues'],3/25/18 0:00,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-25/move-over-mastercard-upstarts-gain-in-hot-india-payments-space,,,,
Continued Biometrics Adoption by Visa & MasterCard Makes the News!,"Two articles today, one for Visa and one for MasterCard, clearly indicates that biometrics will ultimately be the standard for authentication. So only two questions remain; When and Where? As in When will we be able to utilize biometrics to make a payment and Where will that biometric be stored?Mercator identified the compelling advantages to biometrics here and published a timetable for broad consumer adoption of biometrics here; which is not the same as identifying when networks will utilize that authentication infrastructure for payments. Payment adoption of biometrics is more difficult to predict because of the complexity of the payment value chain.This article in Finextra indicates that MasterCard has invested in HYPR and enrolled HYPR in its Start Path Program. HYPR has products that are fully FIDO compliant and while that is not mentioned in this article, one expects that the biometric solution that is ‰ÛÏfully distributed‰Ûù is also FIDO compliant. This is important because FIDO maintains the biometric signature in the handset which eliminates the honeypot of stored credentials that provides significant incentives for criminal activity while also enabling the biometric to be used by other authentication services:‰ÛÏComing on the heels of HYPR‰Ûªs recently announced Series A funding round of $8 million led by RRE Ventures, Mastercard‰Ûªs strategic investment further enables HYPR‰Ûªs decentralized authentication solutions to extend into the millions of users across the Mastercard payments ecosystem. With 30 billion devices connected to the Internet of Things (IoT) by 2020, ensuring they are secure and properly authorized when used to make a purchase is critical. HYPR‰Ûªs decentralized authentication solution improves security and reduces the risk of an enterprise data breach by putting consumers‰Ûª credentials on the device itself instead of in a central database.‰ÛùThe other article was in ZDNet and evaluates Visa‰Ûªs security roadmap and its move towards biometrics.‰ÛÏVisa has lifted the lid on its new security roadmap, focusing initially on biometrics, with Joe Cunningham, Head of Risk for Asia Pacific at Visa, touting the technology as having an important place in the future of payments. Although the technology is not brand new, Cunningham said it is now at a point where Visa and its ecosystem of banks, merchants, fintech firms, service providers, law enforcement, and cardholders feel comfortable supporting it, as he said certain forms of biometrics have reached a stable and secure level. ‰ÛÏWe always expected biometrics to get to a point where they would play an important role in payments, in fact we expected biometrics to play an important role in our lives as we go about our day-to-day business whether it‰Ûªs accessing buildings, our car, or an online service,‰Ûù he said. ‰ÛÏSo there‰Ûªs no surprise that payments has been front and centre when it comes to biometric adoption. ‰Û÷Everyone thinks of biometrics when they think about payments in the future.‰ÛªOverview by Tim Sloane, VP, Payments Innovation and Director of Emerging Technologies Advisory Service at Mercator Advisory GoupRead the full story here","Two articles today, one for Visa and one for MasterCard, clearly indicates that biometrics will ultimately be the standard for authentication.As in When will we be able to utilize biometrics to make a payment and Where will that biometric be stored?Payment adoption of biometrics is more difficult to predict because of the complexity of the payment value chain.This article in Finextra indicates that MasterCard has invested in HYPR and enrolled HYPR in its Start Path Program.‰ÛÏSo there‰Ûªs no surprise that payments has been front and centre when it comes to biometric adoption.","['payment', 'biometric', 'visa', 'mastercard', 'continued', 'authentication', 'payments', 'important', 'biometrics', 'makes', 'adoption', 'service', 'security']",,,[],2017-12-06 11:28:38-04:00,http://paymentsjournal.com/continued-biometrics-adoption-visa-mastercard-makes-news/,,,,

Mastercard's Big Data For Good Initiative: Data Philanthropy On The Front Lines,"Much has been written about big data initiatives and the efforts of market leaders to derive critical business insights faster. Less has been written about initiatives by some of these same firms to apply big data and analytics to a different set of issues, which are not solely focused on revenue growth or bottom line profitability. While the focus of most writing has been on the use of data for competitive advantage, a small set of companies has been undertaking, with much less fanfare, a range of initiatives designed to ensure that data can be applied not just for corporate good, but also for social good.One such firm is Mastercard, which describes itself as a technology company in the payments industry, which connects buyers and sellers in 210 countries and territories across the globe. In 2013 Mastercard launched the Mastercard Center for Inclusive Growth, which operates as an independent subsidiary of Mastercard and is focused on the application of data to a range of issues for social benefit.In an interview with Shamina Singh, President of the Mastercard Center, Ms. Singh described some of the initiatives that the Center is undertaking to address issues of social benefit and social good. According to Ms. Singh, the mission of the Mastercard Center is ‰ÛÏto deploy Mastercard data assets for positive social impact.‰Ûù She describes how, by tapping into a rich set of data assets and talent, the Mastercard Center can help ‰ÛÏunlock the power of data to create sustainable, lasting solutions to society‰Ûªs greatest social challenges.‰Ûù In establishing the Center, Mastercard is hoping to establish a model for corporate big data responsibility that others can emulate.Doing Well and Doing GoodIn testimony before the Senate Committee on Foreign Affairs on May 4, 2017, Mastercard Vice Chairman Walt Macnee, who serves as the Chairman of the Center for Inclusive Growth, addressed issues of private sector engagement. Macnee noted, ‰ÛÏThe private sector and public sector can each serve as a force for good independently; however when the public and private sectors work together, they unlock the potential to achieve even more."" Macnee further commented, ‰ÛÏWe will continue to leverage our technology, data, and know-how in an effort to solve many of the world‰Ûªs most pressing problems. It is the right thing to do, and it is also good for business.""Mastercard believes that there is an opportunity to break down traditional business and data silos to create greater opportunity for social and economic inclusion, which they characterize as ‰ÛÏinclusive growth.‰Ûù As an example, Mastercard executives point to the addition of 500 million new consumers and 40 million new merchants as instances of how the world‰Ûªs 2 billion underserved constituencies can be brought into the global economy. The firm believes that greater financial inclusion around the world is a path to long-term sustainable economic growth. It was for this reason, and with this vision of the future in mind, that Mastercard launched the Center. Today, the Mastercard Center is committed, through a series of initiatives, to working on the front lines to foster inclusive growth.Data Have‰Ûªs and Have Not‰ÛªsMs. Singh describes the world today of ‰ÛÏthe data have‰Ûªs and the data have nots,‰Ûù where Mastercard can play a critical role as a change agent to reduce the current gap. According to the U.N. Advisory Group on a Data Revolution for Sustainable Development, ‰ÛÏNew technologies are leading to an exponential increase in the volume and types of data available, creating unprecedented possibilities for informing and transforming society.‰Ûù The U.N. Group goes on to state ‰ÛÏBut, too many people, organizations, and governments are excluded [from the new world of data] because of lack of resources, knowledge, capacity, or opportunity. There are huge and growing inequalities in access to data and information and in the ability to use it‰Ûù. Ms. Singh notes, ‰ÛÏIf income inequality is the issue of our generation, information inequality is a problem for the ages.""Data PhilanthropyCentral to the mission of the Mastercard Center is the notion of ‰ÛÏdata philanthropy‰Ûù. This term encompasses notions of data collaboration and data sharing and is at the heart of the initiatives that the Center is undertaking. The three cornerstones on the Center‰Ûªs mandate are:Sharing Data Insights‰ÛÒ This is achieved through the concept of ‰ÛÏdata grants‰Ûù, which entails granting access to proprietary insights in support of social initiatives in a way that fully protects consumer privacy.Data Knowledge ‰ÛÒ The Mastercard Center undertakes collaborations with not-for-profit and governmental organizations on a range of initiatives. One such effort was in collaboration with the Obama White House‰Ûªs Data-Driven Justice Initiative, by which data was used to help advance criminal justice reform. This initiative was then able, through the use of insights provided by Mastercard, to demonstrate the impact crime has on merchant locations and local job opportunities in Baltimore.Leveraging Expertise ‰ÛÒ Similarly, the Mastercard Center has collaborated with private organizations such as DataKind, which undertakes data science initiatives for social good. Mastercard provided DataKind with 100 data scientists to work on social impact projects in U.S. cities and globally. As DataKind founder and CEO Jake Porway explains, ‰ÛÏdata is in abundant supply, but human capital is scarce. The Mastercard Center teamed up with us to provide data and the data scientists.‰Ûù The range of social impact projects that the data science teams tackled included initiatives correlating disease and scarcity of food sources in Africa, teaming with the Red Cross to reduce fire deaths in America, and working with a community college to track drop out and success rates.Data for Good InitiativesMastercard has long been committed to deploying its data assets and expertise for greater social benefit. Vice Chairman Macnee sets the tone when he speaks of ‰ÛÏintegrating purpose into our work at Mastercard.""Under the leadership of Shamina Singh and Mr. Macnee, the Mastercard Center for Inclusive Growth, is combining data, expertise, technology, and philanthropic investments, and bringing together stakeholders from business, government, academia, non-profits (NGO‰Ûªs) and a global community of thinkers, leaders, and innovators to tackle challenges stemming from the growing data divide.Just this past month, the Mastercard Center released initial findings from its Data Exploration: Neighborhood Crime and Local Business initiative. This effort was focused on ways in which Mastercard‰Ûªs proprietary insights could be combined with public data on commercial robberies to help understand the potential relationships between criminal activity and business closings. A preliminary analysis showed a spike in commercial robberies followed by an increase in bar and nightclub closings. These analyses help community and business leaders understand factors that can impact business success.Late last year, Ms. Singh issued A Call to Action on Data Philanthropy, in which she challenges her industry peers to look at ways in which they can make a difference -- ‰ÛÏI urge colleagues at other companies to review their data assets to see how they may be leveraged for the benefit of society.‰Ûù She concludes, ‰ÛÏthe sheer abundance of data available today offers an unprecedented opportunity to transform the world for good.‰Ûù DataKind‰Ûªs Porway agrees, ‰ÛÏthrough the Center for Inclusive Growth, Mastercard is setting an example of corporate leadership by taking a thoughtful approach to combining data and expertise to deliver positive social impact.‰ÛùRandy Bean is an industry thought-leader and author, and CEO of NewVantage Partners, a strategic advisory and management consulting firm which he founded in 2001. He is a contributor to Forbes, Harvard Business Review, MIT Sloan Management Review, and The Wall Street Journal, and is Founder and Executive Director of the Big Data for Social Justice Foundation.

Mastercard launches its own blockchain payments network,"Mastercard is launching its own blockchain network to enable partner banks and merchants to make cross-border payments faster and more securely.The Mastercard blockchain service can be used to clear credit card transactions, eliminate administration tasks using smart contract rules and thus, speed transaction settlement.""By combining Mastercard blockchain technology with our settlement network and associated network rules, we have created a solution that is safe, secure, auditable and easy to scale,"" Ken Moore, executive vice president for Mastercard Labs said in a statement.On Saturday, Mastercard will also sponsor the Money20/20 Hackathon, where the company will make the Mastercard Blockchain API available for participating developers.Blockchain is a public electronic ledger ‰ÛÒ similar to a relational database ‰ÛÒ that can be openly shared among disparate users and that creates an unchangeable record of their transactions, each one time-stamped and linked to the previous one.Mastercard's blockchain is a private, permissions-based network, meaning only those authorized to participate in transactions can see them.The credit card giant is another among several financial services organizations that have deployed blockchain-based cross-border payment networks.Earlier this week, IBM announced it had partnered with a Polynesian payments system provider and an open-source FinTech payment network to implement a new international exchange based on a blockchain electronic ledger.[ To comment on this story, visit Computerworld's Facebook page. ]That new payment network uses IBM's Blockchain Platform, a cloud service, to enable the electronic exchange of 12 different currencies across Pacific Islands as well as Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom.Maersk A new blockchain solution from IBM and Maersk will help manage and track the paper trail of tens of millions of shipping containers across the world by digitizing the supply chain process.Jeffrey Neuburger, partner with Proskauer Rose LLP, an international law firm specializing in corporate finance, characterized IBM's blockchain deployment as ""a major milestone for implementation of blockchain in major financial institutions.""IBM partnered with KlickEx Group, a United Nations-funded, Pacific-region financial services company, and Stellar.org, a nonprofit organization that supports an open-source blockchain network for financial services, to create the new cross-border payments service.That partnership is likely to be a ""watermark event in the growth of blockchain and digital currencies,"" Neuburger said.""A lot is riding on the success or failure if this. Particularly interesting because the participants created their own digital currency for this implementation, and it will be interesting to see how regulators, among others, will receive this,"" Neuburger said.Mastercard's blockchain is integrated into the company's payment network that includes 22,000 financial institutions to move funds that have been committed on the blockchain.Mastercard's financial services and merchant customers will be able to connect into its blockchain network using an API, alleviating them from having to build out their own distributed ledger server nodes. Once a part of the blockchain network, banks and retailers can add their own internal nodes to scale capacity, Mastercard said.""When it comes to payments, we want to provide choice and flexibility to our partners where they are able to seamlessly use both our existing and new payment rails based on the needs and requirements of their customers,"" Moore said.","Mastercard is launching its own blockchain network to enable partner banks and merchants to make cross-border payments faster and more securely.""By combining Mastercard blockchain technology with our settlement network and associated network rules, we have created a solution that is safe, secure, auditable and easy to scale,"" Ken Moore, executive vice president for Mastercard Labs said in a statement.On Saturday, Mastercard will also sponsor the Money20/20 Hackathon, where the company will make the Mastercard Blockchain API available for participating developers.IBM partnered with KlickEx Group, a United Nations-funded, Pacific-region financial services company, and Stellar.org, a nonprofit organization that supports an open-source blockchain network for financial services, to create the new cross-border payments service.Once a part of the blockchain network, banks and retailers can add their own internal nodes to scale capacity, Mastercard said.","['blockchain', 'services', 'payments', 'financial', 'transactions', 'launches', 'network', 'neuburger', 'ledger', 'mastercard', 'payment']",,,['Lucas Mearian'],,https://www.computerworld.com/article/3234372/financial-it/mastercard-launches-its-own-blockchain-payments-network.html,,,,
Mastercard Will No Longer Be Asking for Your Signature‰ÛÓHere‰Ûªs Why,"Atstock Productions/ShutterstockWhen EMV ‰ÛÏchip‰Ûù cards were introduced as the new standard for debit card (here are 10 fraud risks of using a debit card) and credit transactions, people got, well, chippy. Financial institutions cited the additional fraud protection which this new bit of technology provided, but according to Fortune, those claims might be a bit dubious. Regardless of their efficacy, the chip cards bring with them one major change to any given shopping experience: an increase in transactional duration.For the optimist, these extra few seconds provided some moments for checkout line introspection. For the pessimist (see: everyone) it just added a few extra seconds wasted in a queue. But luckily for all the time-hoarders out there, your excessive line time is about be cut back down to pre-chip card levels, at least if you use Mastercard.According to Fast Company, Mastercard will no longer be requiring their cardholders to sign their name when using their debit or credit cards, starting in April of 2018. This move has been part of a steady trend for Mastercard, as the company has been moving away from signatures over the past few years and currently requires a scribble on 80 percent of its transactions.This move is customer sourced, according to the company‰Ûªs press release, ‰ÛÏ[the cardholders] believe it would be easier to pay and that checkout lines would move faster if they didn‰Ûªt need to sign when making a purchase.‰Ûù There won‰Ûªt be a security drop off‰ÛÓ the signature will be replaced with new measure like ‰ÛÏchips, tokenization, biometrics and other newer and more secure methods.‰Ûù Considering most people‰Ûªs stylus signature look less like an autograph and more like something pulled from a Richter Scale, these new measures will probably have a bit more luck preventing fraud.

Why the Visa/Mastercard 'button' threatens Amazon,"Visa and Mastercard's ""single button"" for online payments seems like it would most directly threaten PayPal, but the card networks' campaign puts just as much pressure on Amazon's omnichannel push.It's a product that Amazon has come close to building on its own by extending its merchant services across the web, allowing its subsidiaries and partner merchants to let shoppers pay with the credentials they already have on file with Amazon.com. If Visa and Mastercard usurp this role, it greatly diminishes Amazon's influence in e-commerce and emerging channels.Bloomberg News""A single network button is a barrier to entry,"" said Richard Crone, a payments consultant. ""If there's a single button that has a one-touch type of capability, it becomes the default payments type and is the default winner.""Amazon has reached out in two ways that could cost the company billions of dollars while extending its reach. Amazon is reportedly offering discounts to retailers in exchange for adopting Amazon Pay, the e-commerce giant's online payment service. Amazon has also reportedly made a counter bid of as much as $12 billion to acquire Indian e-commerce giant Flipkart, a company that Walmart is close to acquiring (though Walmart was seen as being the favorite to land Flipkart as of Thursday morning). Amazon didn't return a request for comment by deadline.Amazon's aggressive online merchant acquiring strategy bumps up against Visa and Mastercard's effort to use EMVCo standards to create a single experience for online payments. The card networks contend the current system, in which traditional and alternative payment brands compete for merchant attention, is too cumbersome. A standardized experience would reduce cart abandonment, a major problem for merchants that sell online.""The reason merchants are motivated to add a new tender type is to reduce abandonment rates,"" Crone said. ""And e-commerce now bleeds into all other payment scenarios, such as buy online, order online and pickup, order ahead, e-commerce or in-store.""As with most of its moves outside of its core model, Amazon will rely on bulk to make a quick hit if it acquires Flipkart or reaches out to merchants with discounted fees. Access to Amazon Prime's 100 million members would be attractive to most merchants, and Flipkart would bring Amazon's range of technology, services and international reach to India, with the potential for collaboration on international retail and e-commerce projects.Amazon has already made several moves in the past year to improve its ability to build out omnichannel capabilities, including retail technology, debit rewards and delivery services that go as far as to allow delivery in cars and homes when the owners aren't there.Excluding Amazon's properties, Amazon Pay is on about 78,000 websites, with about 33 million users, about half of whom are Prime members. By comparison, PayPal has 19 million merchants and 237 million users; PayPal's social payment app Venmo has 10 million users and 2 million merchants. Visa has 46 million merchants in its network while Mastercard has about 45 million merchants.Amazon would additionally offer a discount at a delicate time for issuers, merchants and third-party wallets. These groups are debating what constitutes ""card not present"" and what the fee structure should be; this category was once considered riskier than card-present transactions, but the advancement of digital security options has narrowed that gap.""Amazon‰Ûªs offer of a reduction in merchant service fees for merchants who offer the Amazon Pay button is happening when Visa and Mastercard are joining forces to increase the value of their respective payment buttons, and neither of them have the ability to differentiate on price,"" said Thad Peterson, a senior analyst at Aite Group. ""It also positions Amazon to compete against payment facilitators like Stripe and Braintree.""But Amazon also has a challenge that these other companies do not.While Amazon Pay operates distinct from Amazon's e-commerce business and external merchants already play a major role on Amazon's core e-commerce site, Amazon has a model that's also competitive with other merchants' business goals. Larger merchants are more likely to see Amazon as a direct rival, and would not be willing to pay it to handle their transactions.Amazon's strategic moves are often seen as a threat to retailers, an issue Amazon has to overcome to generate merchant acceptance for its payment button. Also, merchant payment fee discounts that are floated in exchange for technology adoption aren't predictably beneficial.""Amazon's discounts] may incentivize a few merchants to carry Amazon Pay alongside PayPal, but not instead of PayPal,"" said Rick Oglesby, president of AZ Payments Group. ""Discount to the merchant isn‰Ûªt a compelling reason for a consumer to switch and it‰Ûªs not likely that Amazon‰Ûªs discount will be so large that it will motivate merchants to strongly promote Amazon Payments, particularly when a huge percentage of the merchant population considers Amazon to be a competitor and they don‰Ûªt want Amazon to get ahold of their customer information.""Visa and Mastercard's single button has challenges of its own.

Stock That‰Ûªs Beating Mastercard and Visa Is Now Tested by Consumer Confidence,"Souring Thai consumer confidence is emerging as a potential threat to a world-beating surge in credit-card provider Krungthai Card Pcl.The firm‰Ûªs total return of 170 percent in the past six months is the best globally for consumer-finance stocks with a minimum $1 billion market capitalization, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Rival AEON Thana Sinsap Thailand Pcl rose 59 percent in the same period. Both non-bank Thai lenders were helped by a jump in consumer confidence that bolstered earnings but is at risk of fizzling.""It‰Ûªll be very tough for Krungthai Card and other credit-card firms to maintain the stellar earnings growth of 2017,"" said Adisorn Mungparnchon, an analyst at Phillip Securities Pcl in Bangkok. Domestic consumption likely isn‰Ûªt robust enough to sustain strong cardholder and lending growth through this year, Adisorn said.Others appear more optimistic on the outlook. Citigroup Inc., for instance, is buying unsecured personal loans and credit-card portfolios from Tisco Financial Group Pcl, betting Thai consumer finance needs will stay high.Shares in Thailand‰Ûªs banks have performed less well over the past six months than Krungthai Card and AEON Thana Sinsap, in part because the banks are grappling with a climb in non-performing loans.Bangkok-based Krungthai Card‰Ûªs net income advanced 33 percent to 3.3 billion baht ($106 million) in 2017. AEON Thana Sinsap‰Ûªs profit increased 56 percent to 750 million baht in the three months through November from a year earlier.Consumer confidence in military-run Thailand dipped in February for the first time in seven months, hurt by further delays in plans for a return to democracy and an uptick in political demonstrations.

Mastercard Inc.'s Dividend Could Double in Just 5 Years,"There are multiple good reasons to love dividend stocks, but one of the best reasons investors should want them in their portfolio is that some of them will see their annual dividend payments grow over the years.Credit card company Mastercard (NYSE:MA) is one company positioned to see strong dividend growth in the coming years. Indeed, based on a quick analysis of Mastercard's recent dividend hikes and its underlying financials, Mastercard's dividend could easily double in less than five years.A look at Mastercard's dividendDividend Yield 3-Year Average Dividend Growth Most Recent Increase Payout Ratio 0.7% 26% 15.8% 21%Mastercard's dividend yield of just 0.7% certainly isn't meaty. But don't bail on this dividend stock yet.A look at the credit card company's 3-year average dividend growth and its most recent dividend hike both highlight Mastercard's affinity for dividend increases. Mastercard's dividend has increased at an impressive average rate of 26% annually over the past three years. And the company's most recent dividend increase of 15.8% was strong, too. Therefore, dividend investors who buy Mastercard stock today aren't just getting a 0.7% dividend yield. They're buying into a rapidly growing dividend.But can Mastercard continue increasing its dividend meaningfully in the years to come? Absolutely. A strong EPS growth trend -- 12% year-over-year growth in the trailing 12 months -- should help Mastercard continue increasing its dividends. Indeed, analysts expect strong EPS growth to continue for years, forecasting Mastercard's EPS to increase at a rate of 15.3% annually over the next five years.But even if Mastercard's earnings growth failed to live up to analysts' rosy expectations, Mastercard is still in a good position to increase its dividend, as its dividend payments amount to just 21% of earnings and 22% of free cash flow.How Mastercard's dividend could doubleWith both a strong trend of dividend growth and the underlying fundamentals to support sustainable dividend increases, it won't take long for Mastercard's dividend to double. Assuming Mastercard can continue increasing its dividend at a similar rate as its most recent 15.8% dividend increase, the company's dividend payments could double in under five years. After doubling, this would bring Mastercard's future dividend yield on today's cost basis to 1.4%.While it's possible that Mastercard may not sustain dividend increases at similar rates in the coming years, it's also worth noting that the company could easily get more aggressive about increasing its dividend in the coming years, doubling its dividend even faster. For instance, if Mastercard increased its dividend at a rate on par with its 3-year average dividend growth rate of 26%, the credit card company's dividend would double in just three years. And investors shouldn't put it past Mastercard to do this. After all, Mastercard has approved some big dividend hikes in recent history, like when it was boosted by 45% in 2015.Sure, investors who buy Mastercard won't get a nice dividend yield up front. But patient investors who buy this dividend stock today will likely be happy they did five years from now.","Indeed, based on a quick analysis of Mastercard's recent dividend hikes and its underlying financials, Mastercard's dividend could easily double in less than five years.A look at the credit card company's 3-year average dividend growth and its most recent dividend hike both highlight Mastercard's affinity for dividend increases.How Mastercard's dividend could doubleWith both a strong trend of dividend growth and the underlying fundamentals to support sustainable dividend increases, it won't take long for Mastercard's dividend to double.Assuming Mastercard can continue increasing its dividend at a similar rate as its most recent 15.8% dividend increase, the company's dividend payments could double in under five years.For instance, if Mastercard increased its dividend at a rate on par with its 3-year average dividend growth rate of 26%, the credit card company's dividend would double in just three years.","['double', 'dividend', 'incs', 'investors', 'rate', 'increase', 'recent', 'mastercards', 'growth', 'strong', 'mastercard', 'yield']",,,"['Daniel Sparks', 'Daniel Sparks Is A Senior Technology Specialist At The Motley Fool.

Mastercard Shows A Window Into Retail‰Ûªs Future,"Mirror mirror on the wall, who‰Ûªs the finest payments stock of them all?Mastercard is making the case for itself at a new concept store in Manhattan‰Ûªs Soho neighborhood. On Monday, Barron‰Ûªs Next toured The Next Big Thing shop to see some of the retail payment technologies that Mastercard has been working on. Mastercard is the latest payments company to see value in showcasing its new tech in a physical store.Before even entering the store, which is open to the public through Oct. 12, you‰Ûªre greeted by a large touchscreen that allows you to browse and purchase from the store‰Ûªs inventory even after the store has closed. Company representatives told us that ‰ÛÏthe 21st century version of window shopping‰Ûù could help stores make use of their expensive real-estate 24/7.It‰Ûªs part of Mastercard‰Ûªs newly launched Internet of Things business line. The company sees plenty of opportunities to ‰ÛÏtransform the physical-store environment,‰Ûù says Stephane Wyper, Mastercard‰Ûªs senior vice president of new commerce partnerships. And given the troubles that retailers have been having amid the shift to e-commerce, companies might be willing to try pretty much anything: magic mirrors included.Mastercard‰Ûªs most intriguing Internet of Things concept was a ‰ÛÏsmart mirror‰Ûù intended to liven up even the most ordinary fitting rooms. The mirror, which has virtual buttons outlined in the glass, scans the tag of items you bring in. You can then request more sizes, see matching items, and pay for it all directly from the mirror.Wyper says the smart mirror should improve the chances that shoppers actually buy the things they bring into the fitting room. A poor-fitting pair of pants can doom a shopping spree, especially once the old clothes go back on. But with the mirror, Mastercard says, shoppers can get an all-new set of clothes to try without heading back out to the floor.As with most new tech, customers will be sacrificing a certain level of privacy. The mirror promises all sorts of data to retailers. Requests for larger sizes, for example, will be tracked and remembered. Your purchase history can be compared to the list of things brought into the dressing room. That‰Ûªs valuable data for a retailer looking to optimize their inventory. Mastercard says it plans to help retailers interpret the data, which should make its own investors happy.Even tech-forward retailers, though, could still be accused of following Amazon‰Ûªs lead. The company unveiled a ‰ÛÏmirror‰Ûù of its own in April -- basically a camera combined with the company‰Ûªs Echo technology.","Mirror mirror on the wall, who‰Ûªs the finest payments stock of them all?Mastercard is the latest payments company to see value in showcasing its new tech in a physical store.Company representatives told us that ‰ÛÏthe 21st century version of window shopping‰Ûù could help stores make use of their expensive real-estate 24/7.But with the mirror, Mastercard says, shoppers can get an all-new set of clothes to try without heading back out to the floor.Mastercard says it plans to help retailers interpret the data, which should make its own investors happy.","['window', 'mastercard', 'future', 'retailers', 'shows', 'mirror', 'company', 'try', 'tech', 'stores', 'things', 'data', 'retails', 'store']",,,['Emily Bary'],,http://www.barrons.com/articles/mastercard-shows-a-window-into-retails-future-1506373225,,,,

Mastercard targets millennial clients with digital money management service,"MasterCard has become the latest financial company to look at integrating digital budgeting tools with financial products in an effort to appeal to the millennial market.The payments company today announced it is launching a new service called Assemble, which it calls a ‰ÛÏprepaid innovation hub‰Ûù designed to allow Mastercard partners or issuers to provide checking, budgeting, and payment features, as well as additional money management tools.Issuers and partners can choose to deploy a white label version of the solution or to integrate specific functions into their current user interfaces through application programming interfaces, the company said.

Verifone POS Adds Mastercard's M/Chip Fast Tech,"Verifone, the payment company, announced news on Thursday (Nov. 2) that it is implementing Mastercard‰Ûªs M/Chip Fast technology across the company‰Ûªs next-generation and heritage payment products.In a press release, Verifone said that North American merchants can provide their customers with speed at the point of sale (POS) similar to paying with a magnetic stripe card, but with EMV security.According to Verifone, M/Chip Fast is designed for grocery, retail, fast food and hospitality environments where speed and convenience are important. The technology enables EMV transactions consistent with those offered globally by Mastercard; however, payments are authenticated in one step, instead of two. That means consumers won‰Ûªt have to wait for full round-trip authorization to return to the card when paying, Verifone said, noting that grocery shoppers, in particular, will notice they will be able to tap or dip and remove cards from the POS terminal while the cashier continues to scan items. As with standard EMV, M/Chip Fast provides counterfeit fraud protection by creating unique codes for all consumer transactions, Verifone added.‰ÛÏRetail is evolving, and our merchants want to offer better, engaging checkout experiences to their customers,‰Ûù said Joe Mach, president of North America, Verifone, in the press release. ‰ÛÏM/Chip Fast effectively prioritizes the parts of transactions that are critical to security. Quicker transaction speed with enhanced payment security are ideal when time is of the essence, such as the holiday shopping season, when checkout lines are especially long. Verifone is committed to supporting new technologies like M/Chip Fast to make EMV adoption a winning experience for both merchants and consumers.‰ÛùThe company said the Verifone Point, the FIPay payment solutions and the Verifone MX, VX and Engage product lines as well as Verifone Carbon, will all support the M/Chip Fast option and Visa‰Ûªs Quick Chip for EMV technology.‰ÛÏThe goal is to deliver great experiences for consumers and merchants,‰Ûù said Linda Kirkpatrick, executive vice president, U.S. Market Development, Mastercard, in the same press release. ‰ÛÏWe believe that M/Chip Fast should be implemented by merchants requiring accelerated checkout in today‰Ûªs fast-moving, competitive retail environment.

"After Rejecting Litepay, Mastercard Patents Its Own Blockchain Technology","Blockchain technology is gaining traction amongst mainstream financial service providers as the technology guarantees security, decentralization, cheaper transaction fees and faster ways of sending funds across the globe. Mastercard has also not been left behind in these developments. This is after it was rumored as being one of the payment card providers that refused to support Litecoin (LTC) and its Litepay project.Mastercard has filed a blockchain system patent to store and verify identity data. The patent application was published on the 12th of April this year. In the abstract of the patent application, the team at Mastercard describes the patent in its intricacies. The team states that traditionally, proof of identy had been provided via government identification, credit cards and business cards and that such proof may be inaccurate or fabricated through fraud. They propose that there is a need for a technical solution to provide for the immutable storage of identity and credential data in a secure and verifiable manner.This news is less than one month after Mastercard declared it had no interest in any cryptocurrencies unless they were backed by a Central Government somewhere in the globe. Ajay Banga, the CEO of Mastercard had been quoted as labelling all other cryptocurrencies without government backing as being ‰Û÷junk‰Ûª.The patent application proves that most financial service providers back the technology of blockchain but still continue to be against the current and major cryptocurrencies in the market. Perhaps this is a case where the big financial institutions are a bit afraid of the potential of crypto, that they want to talk ill about them. They would then proceed in launching their own technology on the blockchain and marketing it to the masses.Litepay was a good idea and had planned to revolutionize crypto by allowing owners to use them for day to day transactions like the regular fiat and debit or credit cards. Users were to load their LTC onto the Litepay cards and use them for regular transactions. The currency conversions were to be done by the service in the back-end software. Price predictions before the Litepay cancellation had even put LTC at $1,000 by the end of the year.[Photo source, PYMNTS.com]","Blockchain technology is gaining traction amongst mainstream financial service providers as the technology guarantees security, decentralization, cheaper transaction fees and faster ways of sending funds across the globe.Mastercard has filed a blockchain system patent to store and verify identity data.The patent application proves that most financial service providers back the technology of blockchain but still continue to be against the current and major cryptocurrencies in the market.They would then proceed in launching their own technology on the blockchain and marketing it to the masses.Users were to load their LTC onto the Litepay cards and use them for regular transactions.","['ltc', 'rejecting', 'blockchain', 'patent', 'technology', 'financial', 'patents', 'cards', 'providers', 'litepay', 'mastercard', 'service']",,,['John P.

3 Stocks You Can Safely Own Until 2030,"Every stock comes with some risks. Even the most dominant company can fade into irrelevance over the long term if too many things go wrong, or if its competitive advantages disappear. Predicting the future is hard, and getting it wrong can be disastrous for your portfolio.There are some companies, though, that have better shots than others at continuing to thrive over the next 12 years. These companies have durable competitive advantages that are unlikely to vanish, making their stocks safer than most. Here's why you should consider Mastercard (NYSE:MA), United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS), and Boeing (NYSE:BA) if you're looking for safety.Low risk, high return potentialNeha Chamaria (Mastercard): You need to have a solid forward-looking thesis to hold a stock with a conviction for as long as 12 years. Think about products and services shaping trends today that could become a way of life a decade from now -- say, online transactions and cashless payments.Sure, you might have already adopted cashless modes of payment, but do you know that nearly 80% of consumer transactions across the globe are still cash-driven? That won't last forever, given rapid advancements in technology and e-commerce, which is why a stock like Mastercard is unlikely to disappoint you over the next decade or more.Mastercard and Maestro are global brands in credit cards and debit cards, respectively. As of Dec. 31, 2017, Mastercard had issued 2.4 billion Mastercard- and Maestro-branded cards around the world. Because the company earns fees every time someone swipes its cards, its business can generate strong margins even as it banks on the ""network effect"" economic moat to expand its reach. Mastercard's returns on invested capital have also been incredibly strong, at 35% or above over the past decade, reflecting a sustainable and lucrative business model.To keep up with rapid technological advancements, Mastercard is now increasingly focused on future technologies like biometrics, QR codes (a type of two-dimensional bar code), mobile payments, and artificial intelligence. In its most recent quarter, Mastercard's revenue and net income hit record highs. As digitization is the likely future of payments, Mastercard looks well-placed to not only be around in 2030, but also to have earned investors solid returns over time.Betting on e-commerceTim Green (United Parcel Service): All signs point to online retail continuing to grow much faster than retail as a whole over the coming decade. Amazon is a driving force behind this trend, but traditional retailers like Walmart and Target have been investing heavily in their online businesses as well. One way to invest in e-commerce is UPS, a company that provides the fast shipping now expected by online shoppers.UPS has enjoyed rising package volumes, thanks to Amazon and now other online retailers, but this growth presents its own challenges. The company has been forced to increase its capital expenditures to keep up with demand, and the peak holiday season has proven to be especially challenging. During the first quarter of 2018, operating profit for the U.S. package segment tumbled more than 20% year over year, even as revenue jumped 7.2%.While these bottom-line challenges are something that investors need to take into account, the growth opportunity for UPS is vast. There are risks, including Amazon's push to handle portions of its own deliveries. But there's little reason to believe UPS won't enjoy growth in package volume for years to come. The stock will react to short-term developments, but it looks like a solid investment for the long run.Flying safelyRich Smith (Boeing): I don't think Boeing stock will set the world on fire, exactly, over the next dozen years. After all, the stock is already up 77% over the last dozen months, so a lot of upside has already been priced in. But do I believe Boeing is safe to own until 2030? Yes.First and foremost, the business is quite safe. Boeing came into this year with a backlog of 5,864 planes ordered and waiting to be built. That was enough work to keep Boeing busy for nearly eight straight years if it ceased booking new orders immediately -- getting you two-thirds of the way to 2030 right off the bat.Of course, Boeing has not stopped taking orders. In fact, through the end of last week it had booked 221 net new orders in 2018, and made 184 deliveries. Thus, Boeing not only kept orders coming in fast enough to replace the orders it fulfilled, maintaining its backlog; it actually grew its backlog to 5,904 planes. If that keeps up, I see no difficulty at all with Boeing remaining in business through 2030.As for the ""safety"" of owning the stock, and not seeing it collapse, that looks pretty secure to me as well. With $12.7 billion in trailing free cash flow (FCF) and an enterprise value (EV) of $197 billion (according to S&P Global Market Intelligence), Boeing trades for an EV-to-FCF ratio of 15.5. The company's projected growth rate is likewise 15.5%, resulting in a perfect 1.0 EV-to-FCF-to-growth ratio -- the very definition of a fairly priced stock.Assuming Boeing keeps up its growth rate -- which the backlog should ensure -- I think this stock should easily be safe to own until 2030.","These companies have durable competitive advantages that are unlikely to vanish, making their stocks safer than most.Here's why you should consider Mastercard (NYSE:MA), United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS), and Boeing (NYSE:BA) if you're looking for safety.Flying safelyRich Smith (Boeing): I don't think Boeing stock will set the world on fire, exactly, over the next dozen years.If that keeps up, I see no difficulty at all with Boeing remaining in business through 2030.Assuming Boeing keeps up its growth rate -- which the backlog should ensure -- I think this stock should easily be safe to own until 2030.","['stock', 'business', 'decade', '2030', 'company', 'cards', 'boeing', 'growth', 'stocks', 'orders', 'mastercard', 'online', 'safely']",,,"['Timothy Green', 'Neha Chamaria', 'Rich Smith', 'Tim Writes About Technology', ""Consumer Goods Stocks For The Motley Fool.

Mastercard could allow cryptocurrency transactions‰ÛÓin a way,"Cryptocurrencies are becoming more popular for many different reasons, but there is one common thread among all of them that appeals most to consumers. Put simply, the fact that governments are not involved in how they operate makes them an attractive alternative to fiat. Now, one of the world‰Ûªs largest credit card institutions has finally come out in support of the money of the future, but with a huge catch.Mastercard has previously said that buying cryptocurrency with its cards would be considered as a cash advance and not a purchase. The difference means a higher rate of interest to consumers, and is one of the reasons that the markets continue to see major instability. Now, Mastercard is backpedaling slightly and is willing to embrace cryptocurrency, but only for coins that are issued by central banks, according to a Financial Times report.This goes against the grain of why cryptocurrencies are here. Bitcoin was created in 2009 in the wake of a severe economic downturn. The sheer brilliance of cryptocurrencies lends itself to not be subjected to the pitfalls of government-backed currencies, the values of which can fluctuate based almost on a whim. If a country needs more cash flow, it prints more money. However, in doing so, it also weakens the currency‰Ûªs‰ÛÓand the entire economy‰Ûªs‰ÛÓvalue over the long term.The second-largest credit card company is currently conducting tests in Japan and Singapore that allow customers to exchange their crypto directly into fiat on their cards. It has employed Know Your Customer (KYC) controls to ensure that the funds are not used for money laundering or other malicious activities. It‰Ûªs a way for MC to get into the crypto game without stepping on financial regulators‰Ûª toes.One country has already started to develop its own version of cryptocurrency, of sorts. Sweden announced earlier this year that its central bank, the Riksbank, could launch the e-Krona within the next couple of years. The new money would not be printed, but, rather, stored by the user on an app or a card tied to a central database to register the funds. While Riksbank may consider this to be a form of cryptocurrency, it‰Ûªs really nothing more than a paper-less currency.Note: Tokens in the SegWit chain are referred to as SegWit1X (BTC) and SegWit Gold (SWG) and are no longer Bitcoin. Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is the only true Bitcoin as intended by the original Satoshi white paper. Bitcoin BCH is the only public block chain that offers safe and cheap microtransactions.","Mastercard has previously said that buying cryptocurrency with its cards would be considered as a cash advance and not a purchase.Now, Mastercard is backpedaling slightly and is willing to embrace cryptocurrency, but only for coins that are issued by central banks, according to a Financial Times report.While Riksbank may consider this to be a form of cryptocurrency, it‰Ûªs really nothing more than a paper-less currency.Note: Tokens in the SegWit chain are referred to as SegWit1X (BTC) and SegWit Gold (SWG) and are no longer Bitcoin.Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is the only true Bitcoin as intended by the original Satoshi white paper.","['cryptocurrency', 'cash', 'card', 'segwit', 'mastercard', 'transactionsin', 'bitcoin', 'allow', 'cryptocurrencies', 'central', 'money', 'way', 'riksbank', 'reasons']",,,"['Jasmine Solana', 'Gerald Fenech', 'Dennis Wafula', 'Eli Afram']",2018-03-20 05:30:51+00:00,https://coingeek.com/mastercard-allow-cryptocurrency-transactions-way/,,,,
Diners Club personal charge card with companion World Mastercard,"Receive 90,000 bonus Qantas or Amplify Points when you apply for a new Amplify Signature credit card, along with a birthday bonus of 10% of points earned in the last 12 months. Includes two airport lounge passes per year. Minimum spend and conditions apply. Click here.IntroductionWith an earning rate of up to two Virgin Australia Velocity points per dollar spent with no points capping to get in your way, the Australian Diners Club charge card with its companion World Mastercard is often overlooked, but it's a compelling option for those who do spend where Diners is accepted.That's because the Diners card now boasts Australia's highest everyday earning rate for Velocity points, and an uncapped earn rate of 0.75 Velocity points per $1 spent everywhere else via the 'backup' Mastercard isn't to be sniffed at either, allowing cardholders to earn points in more places.Being a charge card with no pre-set spending limit, the closing balance must be repaid in full each and every month: there's no option to carry a balance, although it does mean things like hotel pre-authorisations don't inhibit your ability to spend ‰ÛÒ provided you can afford to repay that spending, of course.Diners Club personal charge cards: fast factsGrade/tier: Above-PlatinumAbove-Platinum Card type: Diners Club + World MastercardDiners Club + World Mastercard Loyalty program: Diners Club RewardsDiners Club Rewards Diners Club points earned per $1 spent (Diners Club card): 22 Diners Club points earned per $1 spent (Mastercard): 0.750.75 Excluding: Government payments, which earn no points on either cardGovernment payments, which earn no points on either card Points capping: UncappedFrom the Diners Club Rewards program, points can be converted into a variety of airline frequent flyer and hotel frequent guest programs at varying rates.Here's how many airline or hotel points you could be earning per dollar spent, based on each card's Diners Club Rewards earn rate and the onward conversion rate to each program:Loyalty program Conversion rateEarn rate on Diners ClubEarn rate on MastercardVirgin Australia Velocity1:1 2.0 0.75 Air France/KLM Flying BlueCathay Pacific Asia MilesEtihad GuestGarudaMilesIHG Rewards ClubMalaysia Airlines EnrichQatar Airways Privilege ClubRadisson Rewards*Singapore Airlines KrisFlyerThai Airways Royal Orchid PlusTurkish Airlines Miles & Smiles2:1 1.0 0.375 American Airlines AAdvantageEmirates SkywardsJet Airways JetPrivilegeStarwood Preferred Guest2.5:1 0.8 0.3 EVA Air Infinity MileageLands3:1 0.66 0.25* Formerly Club CarlsonFees, charges and interest: 3/5Annual fee: $299$299 Supplementary cardholder fee: $50$50 Interest rate on purchases: N/A (charge card, no option to carry a balance)N/A (charge card, no option to carry a balance) Interest-free days on purchases: Up to 44Up to 44 International transaction fee: 3.0% (Diners), 3.4% (Mastercard)3.0% (Diners), 3.4% (Mastercard) Minimum income requirement: $35,000 p.a.$35,000 p.a. Minimum credit limit: No pre-set spending limit, but balance must be paid in full each monthEarning points for free flights: 3/5While the Diners Club Rewards scheme has a comprehensive range of partners, they're all positioned as a less attractive choice than Velocity ‰ÛÒ despite often having more favourable redemption rates on flights ‰ÛÒ simply due to the differences in conversion rates that Diners Club applies, giving you fewer frequent flyer points at the end of the day in those other programs.However, if you're chasing Singapore Airlines KrisFlyer miles in particular, there's an easy hack to boost your haul by almost 50%, without costing you anything extra.Because Diners' conversion rate to Velocity Frequent Flyer is twice as generous as for KrisFlyer, and separately, Velocity points can be converted into KrisFlyer miles at a 1.35:1 rate straight from your Velocity account, you could ship your points through Velocity ‰ÛÒ instead of converting from Diners straight to KrisFlyer ‰ÛÒ to maximise your points.For example, converting 100,000 Diners Club points directly to KrisFlyer yields 50,000 KrisFlyer miles, but converting 100,000 Diners Club points to Velocity gives 100,000 Velocity points: and then, converting 100,000 Velocity points into KrisFlyer miles delivers 74,074 KrisFlyer miles at the end of the day, being almost 25,000 extra miles than if you converted straight from Diners.That process essentially boosts your KrisFlyer earning rate to 1.48 miles per $1 spent on Diners Club transactions ‰ÛÒ on-par with 1.5 KrisFlyer miles per $1 spent on the American Express Explorer card ‰ÛÒ and 0.55 miles per $1 spent on the Mastercard.Note that the fees and earning rates are different if you apply solely for a Diners Club charge card sans the companion Mastercard. Even if you don't use it, having the Mastercard attached to your account doubles the number of points you earn on Diners Club spend, so it's a no-brainer when chasing points.Airport lounge access: 4.5/5Flash your Diners Club card at over 700 airport lounges worldwide for free and unlimited access with an onward boarding pass the same day ‰ÛÒ including in major transit hubs such as Singapore, Hong Kong, Dubai and Abu Dhabi.It's a perk you can enjoy regardless of which airline you're travelling with, just as long as you can physically reach the lounge.Closer to home, Diners has lounge partnerships in Sydney (the Rex Lounge at T2), Melbourne (the Plaza Premium Lounge in T2 and the Rex Lounge in T4), Brisbane (the international Plaza Premium Lounge), and Darwin (the Catalina Lounge): all of which can be accessed on presentation of your Diners Club card.Read: Using your Diners Club charge card for airport lounge accessSpeaking of freebies, because the Diners Club card is issued by Citibank, you can also take advantage of the bank's ""free wine every time you dine"" deal at a range of participating Australian restaurants, whether paying for your meal using the Diners Club card or the companion Citibank Mastercard.Free international travel insurance: 3.5/5Book your next overseas flight using your Diners Club card or World Mastercard and you may qualify for free international travel insurance on trips of three consecutive months or less when holding a return ticket before leaving Australia.You could also book and depart on a one-way international flight and be covered on journeys of up to 31 days, subject to the usual policy wording and restrictions, which is handy when your plans aren't yet set in stone.On the downside, there's no cover if you book your flight using frequent flyer points: so if that's your plan, consider paying for your flight using your Diners Club card and use your points to request an upgrade on that flight instead.Also included: interstate flight inconvenience insurance, transit accident insurance, extended warranty cover, complimentary purchase protection insurance and a 'guaranteed pricing scheme'.Diners Club personal charge cards: the verdictDiners Club may not be the most accepted card in town, but it's still welcome at most airlines, hotels, car hire and parking companies, major chain stores and many restaurants, with the backup World Mastercard at hand for use everywhere else.Thanks to an agreement with the Discover network, you'll also find the Diners Club card welcomed across the United States wherever Discover is accepted ‰ÛÒ including on most inflight Internet access portals outside of the US.Pairing that with a strong conversion rate for Velocity Frequent Flyer points and a range of other partners too, the Diners Club personal charge card with the companion World Mastercard could easily pay for itself, once you consider the points you can earn and the other perks like airport lounge access, travel insurance and free wine at participating restaurants.Of course, that assumes Diners Club is accepted where you spend most frequently ‰ÛÒ but if you'll be relying on the backup Mastercard more regularly, it may make sense to use a separate, higher-earning Visa or Mastercard for those purchases instead, to maximise your points, but which may attract its own annual fee.","Diners Club personal charge cards: fast factsGrade/tier: Above-PlatinumAbove-Platinum Card type: Diners Club + World MastercardDiners Club + World Mastercard Loyalty program: Diners Club

Why Mastercard Hasn‰Ûªt Been ‰Û÷Disrupted‰Ûª,"Mastercard has had an incredible run this year, along with other tech-focused companies in the financial services industry including Visa and PayPal. The company‰Ûªs earnings report on Tuesday blew away Wall Street expectations, with revenue jumping 18%. The stock was slightly down on Tuesday, probably because it‰Ûªs already risen 44% this year.It‰Ûªs a remarkable achievement given that Mastercard operates in two industries that have had an uneasy few years -- finance and ‰ÛÏold‰Ûù tech. Financial companies like big banks have been slowed by new regulations. And many tech companies that -- like Mastercard -- came of age decades ago have often been disrupted by newer tech companies. IBM and Oracle are still powerful operators, but they‰Ûªre nowhere near what they once were.But Mastercard has mostly avoided new regulations since the financial crisis, aside from the impact of an amendment to cap fees on debit card transactions. And the company has raced to embrace new technology, making sure that it remains at the center of each transaction, whether that transaction is being conducted on a credit card, a phone, or entirely in the cloud. Apple Pay, for instance, was routed through Visa and Mastercard‰Ûªs systems rather than bypassing them. And Mastercard is partnering with PayPal, blunting competition from PayPal. Mastercard has a co-branding partnership, for instance, on global PayPal debit and credit cards.Venmo, which is owned by PayPal, and Zelle, which works with big banks, do allow people to transfer money directly and they pose some threat to the credit card companies. But Visa and MasterCard have begun partnering with those peer-to-peer systems too to allow people to send money faster.While cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin could eventually make Mastercard and Visa unnecessary, they remain much too inefficient to be used for daily payments.On a conference call after Mastercard‰Ûªs earnings report on Tuesday, Mastercard CEO Ajaypal Banga talked about other new technologies that Mastercard is embracing. It‰Ûªs embracing the Internet of Things by working with Garmin and Fitbit to let people pay just by tapping their smartwatches and partnering with Saks Fifth Avenue and others to integrate payments into augmented reality programs. ‰ÛÏFun and games on the innovation front,‰Ûù Banga said. And a remarkably strong model for staving off competition.Big Picture: Mastercard has smartly kept the ‰ÛÏdisrupters‰Ûù at bay as it has upgraded its payment systems and made smart partnerships.","Mastercard has had an incredible run this year, along with other tech-focused companies in the financial services industry including Visa and PayPal.And many tech companies that -- like Mastercard -- came of age decades ago have often been disrupted by newer tech companies.But Visa and MasterCard have begun partnering with those peer-to-peer systems too to allow people to send money faster.While cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin could eventually make Mastercard and Visa unnecessary, they remain much too inefficient to be used for daily payments.On a conference call after Mastercard‰Ûªs earnings report on Tuesday, Mastercard CEO Ajaypal Banga talked about other new technologies that Mastercard is embracing.","['card', 'visa', 'partnering', 'companies', 'systems', 'paypal', 'financial', 'disrupted', 'credit', 'mastercard', 'tech']",,,['Avi Salzman'],,http://www.barrons.com/articles/why-mastercard-hasnt-been-disrupted-1509478859,,,,

Mastercard's Digital Payments Push,"Mastercard, the payment company, announced a series of digital payment initiatives on Tuesday (Feb. 27) aimed at different segments of the market.In a press release, Mastercard said that as of March 19, Mastercard‰Ûªs Qkr! with Masterpass will be available at all U.K. Pizza Hut locations. With the service, diners at its U.K. restaurants will be able to pay for their meals via their mobile phones without having to ask a waiter for the bill, which, the company said, will save customers 12 minutes on average.Qkr! is a mobile ordering and payments platform developed by Mastercard Labs. It enables consumers to order, pay and split bills from their smartphones without having to queue or wait for a server.‰ÛÏRolling out Qkr! is a fantastic opportunity for us to continue the innovation journey we are on as a brand. Over the last six years, we have invested over å£60 million in transforming our restaurants and menu, and this allows us to continue to improve the service and experience we offer our guests as well as embracing technology, which has become so central to modern culture,‰Ûù said Keith Frimley, IT director of Pizza Hut Restaurants, in the press release.Mastercard also announced a partnership with Dream Payments, a platform designed to get insurance customers paid quickly. The idea behind the partnership is for insurance policyholders to receive fast payments into any payment card or account. Northbridge Financial is the first insurance provider in Canada to use the Mastercard Send platform through the Dream Payments Hub.Citing data from the Insurance Bureau of Canada, the insurance industry in the country pays out about CAD$30 billion in claims annually. The partnership will help insurance companies digitize and automate claims disbursements, Mastercard said in the press release.‰ÛÏMastercard is focused on improving the ways people and businesses pay and get paid, providing more choice, security and convenience,‰Ûù Zahir Khoja, SVP of Global Acceptance & Solutions at Mastercard, said. ‰ÛÏThis collaboration with Dream Payments demonstrates our commitment to expand the reach and depth of digital payments, enabling insurance companies to transform the customer experience.‰ÛùFinally, at the Mobile World Congress being held in Barcelona, Spain, Mastercard announced a partnership with SAP and SAP‰Ûªs Connected Vehicles Network platform. During the next six months, Mastercard said it will offer U.S. consumers the ability to make purchases in-vehicle for things like parking, fuel and food ordering and delivery via a number pilot programs. The programs will be tested in select cities.

Is Visa's Stock Chart Overdue?,"Is Visa's Stock Chart Overdue?We last examined Visa Inc. (V) in the middle of October, writing, ""with prices extended on the upside we could experience a pullback in the short-run to around $105-$104. This dip, should it occur, may be a buying opportunity risking below $102 while looking for gains to the $117-$120 area."" Looking back over the last three months one can see (first chart below) that V made a shallow dip in October and a deeper dip at the end of November. The stock never approached the $102 stop level and now that it has moved above our $117-$120 price target some new parameters are in order.In this daily bar chart of V, below, we can see that the shares are positioned above the rising 50-day simple moving average line and above the rising 200-day line. Currently, V is at a particular wide point with respect to the slower-to-react 200-day line. When prices get too far away from the 200-day line you sometimes see a pullback toward the that line.While the daily volume histogram shows an uneven pattern of activity, the On-Balance-Volume (OBV) line has been rising steadily the past 12 months and tells us that buyers of V have been more aggressive. The strength in the OBV line tends to confirm the uptrend and gives buyers confidence. The trend-following Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) oscillator is in a very bullish trend above the zero line.In this weekly bar chart of V, below, we can see that the slope of the 40-week moving average line has done a great job in defining the trend and the direction for investors and traders. V also looks a bit extended compared to the 40-week line. The weekly OBV line has been rising nicely since December 2016 and supports the bullish story on this time frame. The weekly MACD oscillator just turned up again to a fresh go long signal.Jim Cramer discusses Visa as well as the 3 best sectors that have lifted the stock market here.In this Point and Figure chart of V, below, we can see a very important breakout at $83.91 and other smaller breakouts over the past year. A $118.91 price target is shown and obviously passed. Passing a price target or overshooting a target is not unusual in a bull market. This is not a reason to sell but it can make the odds of a correction more likely. Corrections can be a pullback or dip or they can be sideways affairs. Sometimes you can observe an alternation in the kinds of corrections a stock makes -- sideways and shallow corrections can alternate with deeper corrections.Bottom line: The price of V is extended when compared to the 200-day moving average and the 40-week moving average. You could call it ""overbought"" if you like that phrase better. Early in a rally being overbought is a sign that a stock is strong and likely to carry still higher. Later in an advance overbought means new buyers need to be careful and think carefully about buying ""at the market."" However things play out, I would suggest raising sell stop protection to just below the last low or a close below $106.","Is Visa's Stock Chart Overdue?The stock never approached the $102 stop level and now that it has moved above our $117-$120 price target some new parameters are in order.In this daily bar chart of V, below, we can see that the shares are positioned above the rising 50-day simple moving average line and above the rising 200-day line.Passing a price target or overshooting a target is not unusual in a bull market.Bottom line: The price of V is extended when compared to the 200-day moving average and the 40-week moving average.","['target', 'rising', 'stock', 'moving', 'average', 'line', 'visas', 'v', 'dip', 'overdue', 'price', 'chart']",,,[],,https://realmoney.thestreet.com/articles/01/22/2018/visas-stock-chart-overdue,,,,

"Mastercard Romania: By 2020, contactless payments will be the norm","Mastercard Romania: By 2020, contactless payments will be the normMonday, April 30, 2018 ShareIn 2017, Romanians made 100 million contactless payments in Romania, via Mastercard and Maestro cards, representing 60-70 percent of the total payments, business-review.eu informs. At this rate, Mastercard country manager for Romania and Moldova Cosmin Vladimirescu argues, by 2020 contactless payments via mobile phones and smart watches will become the norm.By the end of 2017, contactless payments made in Romania totalled 100 million, Cosmin Vladimirescu told journalists at an event over the week-end. The growth is explosive, when considering that in 2015 only 3 million payments using this method had been recorded.Within two years, the Mastercard representative said, payments via smart watches and smartphones will become a reality for Romanians, given that recent developments paved the way for their upcoming adoption. The market is very willing to adopt these payment technologies, the infrastructure that enables this type of payments is already out there, and several banks are already preparing to integrate bank cards in electronic wallet apps, he said.One example is BT Pay, a digital wallet that enables contactless payments, NFC and other functions, which was launched by Mastercard in partnership with Banca Transilvania at the end of January.‰ÛÏThere is no doubt that Romanians want to pay directly using their smartphone. As long as already 60-70 percent of payments are contactless, it is obvious that this has become the de facto payment method in Romania.‰Ûù‰ÛÏIt took a lot to arrive here, since 2008, when we launched the contactless technology, an until 2017. There were 10 years with massive investments from us, from the banks, of retailers. Once we got used to this type of payment, the transition to smartphones is extremely simple and natural,‰Ûù Vladimirescu said. Everyone already has a smartphone, he recalled Romania‰Ûªs high smartphone penetration rate. According to a forecast published by statista.com, by 2022, in Romania, the share of monthly active smartphone users is projected to reach 52.76 percent of the total population. ‰ÛÏPeople are already making contactless payments, the infrastructure is already on the market,‰Ûù Vladimirescu said.‰ÛÏ22 years since we entered the market, I can say that we are leaders on the credit card, premium, prepaid and contactless transactions market. Almost all electronic meal cards issued in Romania are Mastercard. We are talking about around 1 million meal cards, which have a very high usage rate, and most of the payments are contactless,‰Ûù Vladimirescu said.According to Vladimirescu, the number of cards on the market increased year-on-year in 2017 by 6.5 percent across the entire system. In 2017, the National Bank of Romania (BNR) enrolled 16.43 million cards, compared to 15.9 million in 2016. However, the Mastercard Romanian head pointed out, the BNR did not take into account meal cards, estimated to be around 900,000 in 2017.The total number of active cards increased in the past year by 5 percent, reaching 12.45 million cards, according to the BNR. According to the BNR, the rate of activation stands at 76 percent, but does not include the meal cards, whose activation rate stands at 80 percent.The total number of payments made by card, at either POS and ATM terminals, increased in 2017 by 21.59 percent, to 732 million. The total value of payments made using Mastercard went up by 30 percent year-on-year, from 48.41 percent in 2016 to 63.08 percent in 2017.According to Vladimirescu, while the company cannot be upfront about the exact number of cards, Euromonitor data shows that Mastercard had 9,170.000 cards at the end of 2016.","Mastercard Romania: By 2020, contactless payments will be the normMonday, April 30, 2018 ShareIn 2017, Romanians made 100 million contactless payments in Romania, via Mastercard and Maestro cards, representing 60-70 percent of the total payments, business-review.eu informs.At this rate, Mastercard country manager for Romania and Moldova Cosmin Vladimirescu argues, by 2020 contactless payments via mobile phones and smart watches will become the norm.By the end of 2017, contactless payments made in Romania totalled 100 million, Cosmin Vladimirescu told journalists at an event over the week-end.The growth is explosive, when considering that in 2015 only 3 million payments using this method had been recorded.‰ÛÏPeople are already making contactless payments, the infrastructure is already on the market,‰Ûù Vladimirescu said.","['2017', 'million', 'norm', 'rate', 'romania', 'payments', '2020', 'total', 'cards', 'contactless', 'vladimirescu', 'mastercard']",,,['Actmedia - Romanian Business News'],,https://actmedia.eu/financial-and-banking/mastercard-romania-by-2020-contactless-payments-will-be-the-norm/75199,,,,
Mastercard Survey Finds Cards Cut T&E Costs,"A new report from Mastercard links use of commercial cards to cost savings for businesses, according to reports in Verdict.Mastercard and Kaiser Associates surveyed 26 medium-sized businesses across the Middle East and Africa, and found that use of commercial card products reduces travel and expense management procedures compared with per diem employee expense programs. Costs associated with fraud, errors, and dispute resolution account for more than 8 percent of operational costs associated with per diem trips, which entails a manager allocating a certain daily allowance for traveling employees, the report found.Use of a commercial card program to manage employee travel expenses, however, reduces these operational costs and is linked to add-on benefits like travel insurance and rewards. Companies that switch from per diems to corporate cards save the equivalent of 7.8 percent of the average total T&E spend, Mastercard found.‰ÛÏThe value of commercial cards to deliver automation, transparency and governance to a CFO has never been in question,‰Ûù said Mastercard head of commercial products for Middle East and Africa, Adam Jones, in a statement. ‰ÛÏWhat we have also seen quantified from this research is that T&E budgetary savings can be added when these business tools are used.‰ÛùWhile the report suggests the Middle East is an opportunity for commercial card growth, the Asia Pacific region was named in a 2016 report by Mercator Advisory Group about commercial card growth as a particularly active region for the business card market.‰ÛÏThe diverse region is not necessarily an easy place to do business for financial institutions, but expectations for growth of purchasing cards and virtual cards are positive,‰Ûù the report said, pointing to strong economic growth that has resulted in nearly 20 percent of business spend landing on commercial card products.The travel and expense-management focus for commercial cards is also a high-growth area, Mercator found.Mastercard expanded its commercial card operations with a partnership with Boost Payment Solutions earlier this year in the Caribbean. Together, the companies launched an initiative to promote the use of commercial cards across the Caribbean market and ease supplier acceptance of cards for B2B payments.","A new report from Mastercard links use of commercial cards to cost savings for businesses, according to reports in Verdict.Use of a commercial card program to manage employee travel expenses, however, reduces these operational costs and is linked to add-on benefits like travel insurance and rewards.The travel and expense-management focus for commercial cards is also a high-growth area, Mercator found.Mastercard expanded its commercial card operations with a partnership with Boost Payment Solutions earlier this year in the Caribbean.Together, the companies launched an initiative to promote the use of commercial cards across the Caribbean market and ease supplier acceptance of cards for B2B payments.","['card', 'survey', 'costs', 'business', 'middle', 'report', 'te', 'region', 'cards', 'travel', 'finds', 'growth', 'commercial', 'cut', 'mastercard']",,,[],2018-05-18 08:00:44+00:00,https://www.pymnts.com/news/b2b-payments/2018/mastercard-commercial-card-savings/,,,,
Mastercard and Unilever bring digital lending to Kenyan micro-entrepreneurs,"Mastercard and Unilever bring digital lending to Kenyan micro-entrepreneursFollowing a pilot in Kenya, Mastercard and consumer goods giant Unilever are expanding a digital lending initiative designed to help micro-entrepreneurs in developing countries get credit.In Kenya, the two companies have launched Jaza Duka ('fill up your store'), combining distribution data from Unilever and analysis by Mastercard, on how much inventory a store has bought from Unilever over time.The results from the analysis are used to provide a micro-credit eligibility recommendation to Kenya Commercial Bank, replacing the requirement for formal credit history or collateral, something which sees many entrepreneurs having to turn to informal lenders charging high interest rates.If the micro-credit line from KCB is approved, the store owner is able to increase their purchases. For example, if a store is consistently showing weekly purchases of $50 from Unilever they could qualify for an interest-free credit line of $120 to stock their inventory. The credit line from KCB is provided through a secure Mastercard digital payment solution.As part of the micro-credit, the partners are providing the store owners with training to help them manage their finances, inventory and forward planning for supply against demand. The entrepreneurs are also being trained on marketing tools and techniques to help sell their products.By the end of April, more than 5,000 kiosk owners in the wider Nairobi area had applied to join the programme and all are expected to be fully enrolled by mid-May. Stores that fully moved to the new platform have grown their sales of Unilever products by up to 20%.The two firms have now set themselves the target of getting 20,000 kiosks in Kenya on board by the end of the year and are also planning to expand to other African countries and Asia Pacific. They are also encouraging other financial institutions and consumer good suppliers to jump aboard.Ajay Banga, CEO, Mastercard, says: ""There‰Ûªs an opportunity to set these businesses up for long-term growth by bringing together the tools and data from different industries to change the model of small business financing. We invite other companies and private sector leaders to join us in this collaborative approach and create a true network effect that will bring down barriers and trigger change.‰Ûù","Mastercard and Unilever bring digital lending to Kenyan micro-entrepreneursFollowing a pilot in Kenya, Mastercard and consumer goods giant Unilever are expanding a digital lending initiative designed to help micro-entrepreneurs in developing countries get credit.In Kenya, the two companies have launched Jaza Duka ('fill up your store'), combining distribution data from Unilever and analysis by Mastercard, on how much inventory a store has bought from Unilever over time.If the micro-credit line from KCB is approved, the store owner is able to increase their purchases.For example, if a store is consistently showing weekly purchases of $50 from Unilever they could qualify for an interest-free credit line of $120 to stock their inventory.The credit line from KCB is provided through a secure Mastercard digital payment solution.","['kenya', 'credit', 'digital', 'help', 'microcredit', 'line', 'bring', 'microentrepreneurs', 'unilever', 'lending', 'inventory', 'kenyan', 'mastercard', 'store']",,,[],5/1/18 13:49,https://www.finextra.com/newsarticle/32041/mastercard-and-unilever-bring-digital-lending-to-kenyan-micro-entrepreneurs,,,,

"The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights: IBM, Microsoft, Mastercard, Visa and American Express","For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL - April 10, 2018 - Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include IBM Corp.IBM , MicrosoftMSFT , Mastercard Inc.MA , Visa Inc.V and American Express Inc.AXP .Here are highlights from Monday's Analyst Blog:Blockchain Powering Innovation in Payments IndustryBlockchain is the new buzzword for innovation in the payments industry. Often taken as a synonym for bitcoin, players in the industry are aiming for the blockchain technology given its obvious benefits with regard to speed, accuracy, cost effectiveness, security and much more.The terms blockchain and bitcoin are widely used interchangeably, but the misconception that blockchain is the technology underlying the cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, is changing fast. Though there still remains ambiguity regarding the investment value of the digital currencies which have not yet received broad-based adoption and are often steered clear of, the technology underlying these digital currencies, the blockchain have received a thumbs up in the business world.The Rise of BlockchainAs the name implies, blockchain is a chain of blocks building step by step. As each transaction takes place, it is put into a block, which is then connected to the previous block. The transactions are blocked together to form an irreversible chain.The secured storage and transmission of data through a decentralized database is the most attractive feature of the blockchain technology. Originally used for cryptocurrency transactions, the system is transparent and incorruptible and meant to provide unaltered information.Driven by multi-industrial adoption, the technology has rapidly gained traction over the last few years. The solutions offered by other key players in this domain like IBM Corp. and Microsoft have been adopted by the insurance, banking, food supply and automobile industries among others.There is a huge amount of activity around blockchain technology, and payments is definitely one of the key spaces to watch.Blockchain in Payments IndustryThe attraction of the blockchain technology is hidden in the benefits it provides in three necessary areas of payments - speed, cost and security.Highly Secured: One of the main purviews of a payments company is to provide highly secure payments service, and block chain perfectly fits the bill here. Data for transactions taking place via blockchain can be stored with all details such as the transaction amount, a guarantee of payment, confirmation of the payment and account profiles for the parties involved. Data theft on a blockchain becomes highly impossible because if data is changed on one node, every other node would have to reflect that change for it to take effect. Since blockchain uses a distributed consensus, tampering with its records without being noticed by an entire network is difficult. This makes the system extremely safe.With minimum chances of double counting and hacking, the possibility of monetary losses is low via cybercrime. With increasing instances of cybercrime, which per a recent report by Cybersecurity Ventures is expected to cost global businesses over $6 trillion by 2021, this secured ledger-based technology is bound to gain further importance.Cost Effective: Players are looking forward to blockchain for a solution to address high cost associated with the payments process under the present scenario, which involves costly, time-consuming, paper-based manual process. At present, fees have to be paid to various parties involved in payment processing and at times there are other fees at various other stages of the transaction. All these costs get elimination under blockchain since it nullifies the involvement of a third party in transaction processing, which pulls down overall costs.Speed Enhancement: At present cross border payments are carried out through correspondent banks and not via a central clearing house, which lengthens the whole process, along with making it inefficient. Demand for speedier and efficient service makes blockchain technology the perfect fit here. On a blockchain-based payment, gateway payments can be sent anywhere around the world in 15 to 20 seconds by eliminating intermediaries and using algorithms to verify and authorize payments instantly. This can shorten the whole process which under traditional model takes up to three days, thereby reducing the overall wait time for transaction processing.In Kenya, BitPesa is using the blockchain method to enable companies to make faster, cheaper payments between African countries without having to rely on slow and inefficient local banking infrastructure, according to a Citi Research report.Adoption by CarriersThe blockchain technology is being adopted by industry players with arms wide open.It was recently reported that Ripple, the U.S. digital payments company, is working with 61 Japanese banks to apply blockchain technology for efficient cash transfers.Mastercard Inc. launched its own blockchain network last year to implement the technology in the business-to-business (B2B) space to address challenges of speed, transparency and costs in cross-border payments. The Mastercard blockchain technology will complement the company's existing capabilities including virtual cards, Mastercard Send and Vocalink to support all types of cross-border, B2B payment flows - account-based, blockchain-based and card-based.The company recently joined Enterprise Ethereum Alliance to explore the potential of the ethereum technology across a gamut of uses among which some are outside the scope of Mastercard's traditional payments environment.Another major company Visa Inc. has recently launched Visa B2B Connect, a payment platform powered by the blockchain technology. Via this platform, Visa will offer its services using 23 fiat currencies and 4 partner banks including Commerce Bank in the US, Shinhan Bank in South Korea, Sberbank in Russia and United Overseas Bank in Singapore.Last year, American Express Inc. inked a deal to use the blockchain technology to pay U.K. customers who bank with Santander. Recently, CoinDesk reported that the company has filed a patent related to blockchain. Reports noted that the company's filing emphasized the potential for blockchain to enhance existing card networks.Still a Long Way to GoGiven the fact that the technology is still in its nascent stages, there remains difficulty in understanding its functionality and applicability. It may thus take a few years before it becomes widely accepted. It is nonetheless a fact that blockchain is the forthcoming reality which would be transformational for the payments industry. We therefore expect to see increased activity on this front, going forward.Among the companies mentioned (in the payments industry) above, Visa carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) while Mastercard and American Express each sport a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Mastercard: Corporate cards provide better cost savings,"A new survey conducted by Mastercard in alliance with Kaiser Associates has revealed significant cost savings for organisations which switch to corporate cards from Per Diems, daily allowance paid to cover expenses of employees travelling for work.Data further revealed improved operational procedures and decreased T&E expenses with corporate card programmes.The survey involved 26 large and medium-sized organisations in certain markets across the Middle East and Africa such as the UAE, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Jordan and Kenya.During the study, Mastercard obtained understanding on the Per Diem usage procedures and costs, and compared the findings with corporate cards.Substantial operational costs were found to be associated with each Per Diem trip, with factors like fraud and error correction, approval processes and dispute resolution constituting 8.2% of the average spend.Meanwhile, card programmes offer more efficient operational procedures and other benefits such as travel insurance and rewards, the report says.By switching from Per Diems to corporate cards, organisations on average can save 7.8% of the average overall T&E spend.Mastercard head of commercial products for Middle East and Africa Adam Jones said: ‰ÛÏThe value of commercial cards to deliver automation, transparency and governance to a CFO has never been in question.‰ÛÏWhat we have also seen quantified from this research is that T&E budgetary savings can be added when these business tools are used.‰ÛùThe study also revealed opportunities for corporate card providers to drive the card use in the MEA region by educating their clients on the associated cost savings and efficiency gains.","A new survey conducted by Mastercard in alliance with Kaiser Associates has revealed significant cost savings for organisations which switch to corporate cards from Per Diems, daily allowance paid to cover expenses of employees travelling for work.Data further revealed improved operational procedures and decreased T&E expenses with corporate card programmes.During the study, Mastercard obtained understanding on the Per Diem usage procedures and costs, and compared the findings with corporate cards.Meanwhile, card programmes offer more efficient operational procedures and other benefits such as travel insurance and rewards, the report says.By switching from Per Diems to corporate cards, organisations on average can save 7.8% of the average overall T&E spend.","['card', 'revealed', 'operational', 'mastercard', 'te', 'average', 'cost', 'organisations', 'cards', 'savings', 'better', 'provide', 'corporate', 'procedures']",,,"['Patrick Brusnahan', 'Verdict Staff', 'Briony Richter']",2018-05-17 10:07:12+00:00,https://www.verdict.co.uk/cards-international/news/corporate-cards-provide-better-cost-savings-daily-allowance/,,,,
"Mastercard (MA) Ups Dividend by 14%, Share Buyback by $4B","Banking on three solid quarters of 2017, the board of Mastercard Inc. MA announced incremental capital deployment plans, thereby augmenting shareholder returns.In an attempt to boost capital efficiencies, the company hiked its regular quarterly dividend by 14% to 25 cents per share from the prior payout of 22 cents. The raised dividend will be paid on Feb 9, 2018, to shareholders of record as of Jan 9.The increased payout takes the annual dividend to $1.00 from 88 cents paid in 2017. At the current price, the raised yearly dividend yields 0.7%, up from the prior yield of 0.6%.Alongside this hike, the board of Mastercard sanctioned a new share repurchase program worth $4 billion. Including $1.5 billion from the last approval, the company currently has $5.5 billion worth of shares available for buybacksSolid Capital DeploymentMastercard boasts a strong balance sheet with financial flexibility and continued cash generated (that has been increasing save in 2014) from operating activities since 2009. It generated $4.5 billion of operating cash flow in 2016, up 11% year over year. The same was up 8.5% year over year as of Sep 30, 2017.The company's disciplined capital management strategy by way of share buyback and dividend payments remains impressive. Last December, the company announced a new share buyback program of $4 billion and increased its quarterly dividend by 16%.Factors at PlayArmed with strong liquidity and cash flows, we believe Mastercard is well positioned to implement the latest capital plans. The improved outlook for card spending, cross-border volumes, gross dollar value and payment volume generation given the recent strategic alliances, improving global economies and rapidly growing digital payments are likely to improve financials, going forward.Notably, global spending through credit and debit cards has grown consistently, boosting cross-border volumes, which drives revenues for card giants. Given the onset of the holiday season, we also expect improved transaction volumes and digital payments as shopping and traveling will be in the cards for most global citizens.Moreover, numerous acquisitions made in recent years have further strengthened the company's long-term inorganic growth profile, without risking its capital. These factors will likely lead to lucrative shareholder returns and retain market confidence.Share Price PerformanceSo far this year, the stock has returned 42.8%, significantly outperforming the 25.3% gain logged by the industry .Peer TakeOther players in the same space like Visa Inc. V , Discover Financial Services DFS and American Express Co. AXP raised their dividend payments this year by 18%,16.7% and 9%, respectively. These companies have been generously returning excess capital through share buybacks as well.Zacks RankCurrently, Mastercard carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here .Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021. Early investors stand to make a killing, but you have to be ready to act and know just where to look.See the pot trades we're targeting>>Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Mastercard pilots pay-as-you-go solar equipment in Uganda,"Source: MastercardSimple acts of flicking on a light switch, turning on the heat during a cold night or using water for basic day-to-day activities is inaccessible to many across the world. And if people do have access to these resources, the quality is often poor and jeopardizes their health.Mastercard M-KOPAThe tools they really need to improve their lives require a large investment that has to be paid upfront. With the Internet of Things and the growing adoption of mobile money, pay-as-you-go programs are making it easier for people to access these goods and services by providing them a more flexible way to pay for them.Instead of a one-time charge to buy tools such as a gas stove, they can install it at home and purchase credits to use it over a period of time until it is paid off. The hardware is connected to the internet, enabling the provider to prevent the device from producing gas if credits are depleted.Lighting Up LivesPay-as-you-go can increase access to basic necessities for those in remote areas who are not served by traditional infrastructure and lack financial resources. Solar is a strong example of an industry that has seen a huge boost as a result of pay-as-you-go and is currently electrifying rural Africa.Mastercard and M-KOPA are launching a pay-as-you-go pilot to give Ugandans access to expensive solar equipment that can light up their homes and businesses. Rather than paying a hefty cost upfront, users can make a small deposit and take the panels home with an agreement to pay them off over a year.In this case, Mastercard‰Ûªs Pay-Go application programming interface (API) connects with the M-KOPA hardware that controls its ability to produce light.

By keeping accurate records of payments that a user is making, the user generates verifiable digital identity and trackable credit history which was previously impossible to create or maintain.

Mastercard‰Ûªs Move to the Car Dashboard Steps Up With HERE,"Mastercard‰Ûªs Move to the Car Dashboard Steps Up With HEREJanuary 12, 2018 By: Steven AndersonThe notion of a connected car has only been on the increase in the last few years; seems like fresh news about the connected car has hit the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) every January since at least 2015. Now, recent word has emerged about Mastercard‰Ûªs partnership with HERE Technologies, which has expanded to step up progress on the connected car front.Essentially, Mastercard and HERE are working to make the car the primary vector of commerce so mobile it doesn‰Ûªt even stop. This includes the development of a set of global standards, as well as new application programming interfaces (APIs) designed to add more features to the connected car. One such application is the growth of ‰ÛÏpersonalized discovery‰Ûù tools that allow for not only secure check-out, but also improved loyalty reward program use.Mastercard has, at last report, been working for the last five years on such programs, including not just with HERE, but also with a slate of travel and car companies as well as mass transit providers and others.HERE‰Ûªs chief operations officer and executive vice president Angel L. Mendez noted ‰ÛÏLocation technology and digital payments are at the heart of how we access services in the physical world. Together they enable people, businesses and cities to deliver, and act on, valued information at the right time and location. We look forward to working with Mastercard on a wide-ranging innovation program that will help shape the personal experience of users across transportation modes and within smarter cities.‰ÛùJust recently, we saw how the commuter market represented a whole lot of cash, around $212 billion every year. Having a piece of that market, even a meager one percent, represents a whole lot of liquid cash flooding into someone‰Ûªs coffers. There‰Ûªs little doubt Mastercard is more than aware that, if it manages to become the payment infrastructure provider of choice for cars, it has a great chance to land a slice of that market.While it will certainly have to compete against Visa, individual apps, and a host of banks eager to get in, Mastercard is in a great position to take a healthy slug of this market for itself. This could be one major new payday to come for Mastercard.","Mastercard‰Ûªs Move to the Car Dashboard Steps Up With HEREJanuary 12, 2018 By: Steven AndersonThe notion of a connected car has only been on the increase in the last few years; seems like fresh news about the connected car has hit the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) every January since at least 2015.Now, recent word has emerged about Mastercard‰Ûªs partnership with HERE Technologies, which has expanded to step up progress on the connected car front.Essentially, Mastercard and HERE are working to make the car the primary vector of commerce so mobile it doesn‰Ûªt even stop.This includes the development of a set of global standards, as well as new application programming interfaces (APIs) designed to add more features to the connected car.Together they enable people, businesses and cities to deliver, and act on, valued information at the right time and location.","['steps', 'dashboard', 'market', 'great', 'connected', 'working', 'lot', 'mastercards', 'program', 'car', 'mastercard', 'location']",,,[],1/12/18 0:00,https://paymentweek.com/2018-1-12-mastercards-move-car-dashboard-steps/,,,,
Mastercard Profit Boosted by Card Customers Traveling Abroad,"Mastercard Inc. was a hit with tourists last quarter.Customers spent more with the firm‰Ûªs plastic when they traveled abroad in the first three months of the year, aided by a weakening U.S. dollar. Cross-border volume on Mastercard‰Ûªs network climbed 32 percent in the quarter, the fastest clip in at least two years, the Purchase, New York-based firm said Wednesday in a statement.As cross-border spending climbed, the firm raised its guidance for full-year revenue growth to a percentage in the ‰ÛÏlow 20s.‰Ûù It previously said revenue would grow at ‰ÛÏthe low end of high-double digits.‰ÛùCross-Border Craze Cross-border spending climbed 32 percent compared with a year ago, Mastercard said Source: Company filingsMastercard rose 2.8 percent to a record $185.33 at 11:41 a.m. in New York. The shares have jumped 22 percent this year, compared with the 5.1 percent advance of the 69-company S&P 500 Information Technology Index.‰ÛÏPeople love to buy stuff here and they‰Ûªre spending more in the U.S.,‰Ûù especially with the weaker dollar, Chief Financial Officer Martina Hund-Mejean said in a telephone interview. ‰ÛÏWe also have seen some strong outbound purchasing behavior by Americans who are either traveling or purchasing goods overseas.‰ÛùThat cross-border growth will probably moderate due to a drop-off in consumers using their credit-cards to fund cryptocurrency purchases, Hund-Mejean said. In the first quarter, JPMorgan Chase & Co., Bank of America Corp. and Citigroup Inc. said they would halt purchases of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies on their credit cards because they didn‰Ûªt want the credit risk associated with the transactions.Hund-Mejean said the firm‰Ûªs cross-border volume growth was helped by Chinese lenders once again issuing credit cards with foreign-payment networks such as Mastercard. That had been curtailed by the People‰Ûªs Bank of China.High ExpectationsTotal spending on the firm‰Ûªs network climbed 20 percent to $1.04 trillion, topping the $1.01 trillion estimate from analysts at Oppenheimer & Co.‰ÛÏThe investments are in the areas they need to be,‰Ûù said Tom Plumb, president and fund manager at Wisconsin Capital Management, which owns shares of Mastercard. ‰ÛÏEveryone expected them to have a very good quarter and this is beyond even what the highest expectations were.‰ÛùA weaker U.S. dollar boosts Mastercard‰Ûªs profits outside the U.S., where the firm gets most of its revenue. The company has been lowering fees and sweetening rewards in a bid to ink card deals with banks, especially in Europe, where competition has intensified since Visa Inc.‰Ûªs $20 billion purchase of Visa Europe in 2016.Visa said last week that it also benefited from a weaker U.S. dollar in the first three months of the year as foreign spending in the U.S. increased at a double-digit pace for the first time in more than four years. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index, which tracks the greenback against 10 major currencies, dropped 3 percent during the quarter, the fifth consecutive quarterly drop.Here are other key metrics from the quarterly results:Net income rose to $1.49 billion, or $1.41 a share, from $1.08 billion, or $1, a year earlier. That exceeded analysts‰Ûª $1.24 average estimate.Operating expenses climbed 43 percent to $1.76 billion, the company said, driven in part by an increase in costs related to ‰ÛÏstrategic initiatives,‰Ûù which include technology investments. That topped the $1.58 billion average of 12 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.Mastercard spent $1.49 billion on rebates and incentives for banks to issue cards on its network in the quarter. That came in lower than the $1.54 billion analysts expected.‰ÛÓ With assistance by Will Mathis","Customers spent more with the firm‰Ûªs plastic when they traveled abroad in the first three months of the year, aided by a weakening U.S. dollar.Cross-border volume on Mastercard‰Ûªs network climbed 32 percent in the quarter, the fastest clip in at least two years, the Purchase, New York-based firm said Wednesday in a statement.‰ÛÏPeople love to buy stuff here and they‰Ûªre spending more in the U.S.,‰Ûù especially with the weaker dollar, Chief Financial Officer Martina Hund-Mejean said in a telephone interview.Hund-Mejean said the firm‰Ûªs cross-border volume growth was helped by Chinese lenders once again issuing credit cards with foreign-payment networks such as Mastercard.Mastercard spent $1.49 billion on rebates and incentives for banks to issue cards on its network in the quarter.","['boosted', 'crossborder', 'abroad', 'weaker', 'mastercard', 'customers', 'climbed', 'traveling', 'billion', 'spending', 'profit', 'quarter', 'network', 'revenue', 'card', 'dollar']",,,['Jennifer Surane'],5/2/18 0:00,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-02/mastercard-profit-gets-a-boost-from-customers-traveling-abroad,,,,

Why Visa and MasterCard May Have Fallen Too Far,"(Note: The author of this fundamental analysis is a financial writer and portfolio manager. He and his clients own shares of MA and V.)Visa Inc. (V ) and MasterCard Inc. (MA) shares have been caught in a vicious selloff over the past few trading sessions that has pushed down the payment processors' stocks by nearly 4 and 6 percent respectively. The declines may have gone too far. Both companies hold strong market positions in their industry and expectations for future growth remain strong, one reason these stocks are up by nearly 40 percent this year despite the recent retreat. Now, the drop in these shares has helped reset them on a technical basis.Whether warranted or not, the two stocks' declines have been in line with the broader technology selloff. The Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLK) has fallen by nearly 3 percent during the same period. Both MasterCard and Visa are regarded by many investors as technology companies at their core.V Price data by YChartsFundamentally StrongBoth Visa and MasterCard are trading at roughly at 23 times fiscal 2019 earnings estimates. It is tough to make an argument that the recent selloff in these stocks was due to valuation since both stocks are expected to increase earnings at a rate in the mid-to-high teens over the next few years. Analysts' consensus estimates call for fiscal 2018 earnings growth of nearly 17 percent for Visa and MasterCard, according to Ycharts.Visa Appears OversoldVisa has now fallen below the lower range of its trading channel. The last time that happened was in July, when the stock dropped to around $93, leading to the massive 22 percent run higher in the stock to roughly $113.50MasterCard Well PositionedFor its part, MasterCard was moving through the upper range of its trading channel, which shows how the stock initially may have become overbought on a technical basis over the past month. But the stock has now fallen well back to the middle of its trading channel.While these forces position both MasterCard and Visa to rise, both stocks' link to the tech sector in investors' minds may determine their fate this month and in 2018. If the tech stocks continue their upward trajectory, the two processors are likely to enjoy the ride. If the tech stocks crumble, so too may MasterCard and Visa - and along them investors' paper profits.Michael Kramer is the Founder of Mott Capital Management LLC, a registered investment adviser, and the manager of the company's actively managed, long-only Thematic Growth Portfolio.

Losses remained mild, however, led by Verizon's (VZ) 0.5% slip.The S&P 500 slid 0.1%, with Juniper Networks (JNPR) staking the early lead among S&P 500 stocks.Apple Jumps, Mastercard Scores BreakoutMastercard popped more than 3% in early action. First quarter revenue and profit growth topped analyst targets, although Mastercard operating margins decreased on a surge in expenses. The opening gain sent the stock above an 183.83 buy point in a second-stage flat base.Apple also opened more than 3% higher on better-than-forecast earnings and revenue, a 16% dividend increase and the launch of a $100 billion share buy back program. Apple shares have been locked in consolidations since late January. The current consolidation is a flat base with a 183.60 buy point, and an alternative entry at 179.04.Apple's after-hours gain Tuesday pointed to an open back above the stock's 50-day moving average and 2% below the base's alternative entry.Apple also helped boost Europe's markets, which traded unevenly higher despite data showing eurozone manufacturing slowed to a 13-month low in April. Germany's DAX led the advance among Europe's top benchmarks, up 1.3% in its afternoon session. Chip stocks shifted higher, and shares of Switzerland-based AMS, maker of the facial recognition software used in iPhones, surged more than 8%.Fed Rate WatchInvestors largely expect no change in policy from this afternoon's announcement. The CME Group's FedWatch Tool shows futures pointing to a 94.3% probability of a vote to hold rate targets at their current 1.5%-1.75% range. But the Fed's comments will be carefully parsed for any indication of how future hikes may play out, or of any change to the committee's view on inflation and the economy .Crude Oil Prices, Inventories Data, EarningsCrude oil prices added 0.3% early Wednesday, with U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate holding easily above $67 a barrel. That is a bit more than 3% below the 41-month high set on April 19.Oil prices dropped nearly 2% Tuesday, after American Petroleum Institute data showed a 3.4 million-barrel increase in oil stockpiles, vs. expectations for a smaller increase of 739,000 barrels. Gasoline inventories rose 1.6 million barrels, confounding forecasts for a 587,000-barrel decrease. The API data is a precursor to the weekly crude stockpiles report from the Energy Information Administration, due for release at 10:30 a.m. ET.Oil names Concho Resources (CXO) and Viper Energy Partners (VNOM) jumped more than 2% apiece in opening trade after reporting first-quarter earnings beats late Tuesday. Continental Resources (CLR), Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD) and Matador Resources (MTDR) all report quarterly results after today's close.Cirrus Leads Chip Stocks, Shutterfly Clears Buy Point, Snap DivesChip stocks were mixed at the open, as the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index fought to add a third straight gain. The index surged 1.7% on Tuesday. Cirrus Logic (CRUS) rose almost 3%, and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) advanced 1.2% in early trade. Cirrus reports its fiscal fourth-quarter results after today's closing bell. Skyworks reports late Thursday. Intel posted one of the heaviest losses among chipmakers, down 1.1% at the start of trade.Milpitas, Calif.-based chipmaker Nanometrics (NANO) spiked 16% after scoring a huge first-quarter sales and profit beat late Tuesday.Juniper Networks surged 8% on strong first-quarter results reported late Tuesday. Terex (TEX) and Ocwen Financial (OCN) each muscled up nearly 5% following their early Wednesday reports.Shutterfly (SFLY) flitted 11% higher after results showed it had trimmed losses more than expected for the first quarter. A 4% revenue gain topped targets. The move marked a breakout past a cup with handle buy point at 84.81. Shutterfly has a weak 45 EPS rating from IBD, but earnings are expected to jump 145% this year, following a 133% EPS gain in 2017.Software developer Zendesk (ZEN) swept ahead more than 95. The Redwood City, Calif., company turned in a strong first-quarter sales and earnings beat, and raised second-quarter guidance above consensus views. Zendesk is projected to post its first annual profit this year, and a 625% EPS gain in 2019. The advance lifted shares just above a 51.01 buy point in a three-weeks-tight pattern.Snapchat parent Snap (SNAP) led the stocks moving lower on earnings news early Wednesday. The 14-month old social media icon dived 21% early action. The Venice, Calif. outfit reported weaker-than-expected revenue growth, and an increase of 4 million daily active users during the quarter fell short of targets for a 7-million-user gain. Snapchat shares ended Tuesday down 33% from a February high, and 17% below the stock's March 2017 IPO price.RELATED:Mastercard Stock Poised For Breakout After Q1 Earnings BeatOil Prices Mixed Ahead Of Earnings From These Top Shale CompaniesStocks Power Up, And Apple Earnings Add FuelApple Services, Wearables Offset Slowing iPhone SalesLockheed, Northrop Lead Defense Stock Dive As Sector Woes Continue2 Very Different Stocks, With A Common Trait, Report Earnings Thursday","The Dow Jones industrials average fell 0.1%, with Intel (INTC) falling furthest and more than two-thirds of the 30 Dow stocks losing ground.The opening gain sent the stock above an 183.83 buy point in a second-stage flat base.The current consolidation is a flat base with a 183.60 buy point, and an alternative entry at 179.04.The move marked a breakout past a cup with handle buy point at 84.81.The advance lifted shares just above a 51.01 buy point in a three-weeks-tight pattern.","['shares', 'dow', 'fed', 'rises', 'late', 'lags', 'apple', 'buy', 'gains', 'targets', 'breaks', 'limits', 'results', 'stocks', 'gain', 'mastercard', 'earnings', 'early', 'point']",,,"[""Investor'S Business Daily"", 'Alan R.

Mastercard Stock Rises Among Regulatory Concerns,"Mastercard came out ahead of Wall Street‰Ûªs forecasts when its Q3 earnings report hit the wires before the markets opened yesterday ‰ÛÒ notching a beat on both earnings and revenue, with significant growth in transaction volume and global market share. Markets rewarded the good news with a 1.8 percent increase in share price during premarket trading.There were some concerns raised by a potential regulatory fine from the European Commission over its inter-regional interchange fees. In an SEC filing, Mastercard noted they could not, at this time, offer an estimate of what a potential fine might look like ‰ÛÒ but did note that it could potentially exceed $1 billion, ‰ÛÏbased upon recent interactions‰Ûù Mastercard has had with the Commission.Potential regulatory uncertainty aside, however, Mastercard CEO Ajay Banga was upbeat about the results ‰ÛÒ and what‰Ûªs next, particularly as it relates to securing an increasingly digital commerce-based world.‰ÛÏWe are executing well on our strategy and are pleased to deliver another quarter of record results,‰Ûù said Banga. ‰ÛÏAs the world becomes more connected, we remain very focused on security. Our investments in technologies like biometrics, tokens, encryption and artificial intelligence are redefining the way both consumers and transactions are protected.‰ÛùBy The NumbersNet income in Q3 was up $1.43 billion, from 1.18 billion at the same time last year. Revenue came in at $3.4 billion, up from $2.8 billion a year ago, and beating analyst expectations of $3.2 billion. Earnings per share came in at $1.34 per share, up from $1.08 a year ago and beating analyst estimates of $1.23.As of Sept. 30, the company‰Ûªs customers had issued 2.4 billion Mastercard and Maestro-branded cards worldwide. Gross dollar volume picked up 10 percent during the quarter, while purchase volume was up 11 percent.‰ÛÏIn the U.S., we continue to see steady economic growth, low unemployment and inflation,‰Ûù said Banga on a post-earnings call. ‰ÛÏConsumer sentiment is favorable.‰ÛùSecurity, Partnerships And Pushing For A More Digital WorldNoting that the improved situation in worldwide markets ‰ÛÒ from the EU to Asia Pacific to Latin America ‰ÛÒ had contributed to ‰ÛÏdouble-digit volume and transaction growth across most of our markets,‰Ûù Banga told investors the focus is now on continuing to execute and expand its global payment digitization strategy.He also noted the firm‰Ûªs recent push to forge partnerships, particularly with PayPal, which has seen the implementation of Masterpass through Braintree to ‰ÛÏbroaden our digital acceptance footprint.‰Ûù Banga also praised Mastercard‰Ûªs same-day ACH system that is now up and running in the U.K. through its VocaLink acquisition, and coming soon to the U.S. market.‰ÛÏWe‰Ûªve just gone live yesterday, in fact, in the U.K. with a new image-based clearing system for the check and credit clearing company, which basically helps to speed up the traditional approach by digitizing that process,‰Ûù Banga noted.He also announced additional upcoming partnerships, including one with Costco, which will utilize Mastercard as its exclusive co-brand partner in Japan starting early next year. Banga also noted a new comprehensive agreement with Uber that ‰ÛÏgoes beyond acceptance to include activation and usage campaigns.‰Ûù The new partnership will also see Masterpass integrations in ‰ÛÏselect markets.‰ÛùPush payments got a rare call-out during Banga‰Ûªs remarks as well. He noted that Mastercard‰Ûªs push payment‰Ûªs solution, Mastercard Send, is now capable of reaching ‰ÛÏpretty much all debit cards in the U.S.‰Ûù as well as other locations like physical cash-out points, mobile wallets and banks accounts in over 100 global markets. Users of the service have included the American Red Cross, which used Mastercard Send to push disbursements to consumer cards in hurricane-ravaged parts of Florida and Texas.Another example Banga pointed out is its partnership with Western Union, whose U.S. customers will now have the option to receive funds from other family members and relatives in the U.S. directly to their debit cards.Security was also a starring player, as some analysts were curious about how Banga felt the Equifax breach has impacted the card business. Banga noted that while he thought it would be a mistake to immediately equate all instances of fraud increases with Equifax, security remains top of mind for the company.He further noted that the firm recently added an early detection system that alerts card issuers to the risk of future fraudulent activities, and has expanded tokenization for consumer card information that companies keep stored. Those tokenized card credentials are essentially unusable if stolen, lessening the chances that card credentials can be fraudulently used should a retailer‰Ûªs database be hacked, Banga said. Mastercard noted that Netflix is the first company to have signed on to use its service.‰ÛÏIt‰Ûªs no secret right now that protection of consumer data is a hot topic,‰Ûù he said. ‰ÛÏSafety and security is a key priority.‰ÛùThe Five Killer Stats$3.8 trillion: Total value of transactions processed in 2017 so far (gross dollar volume)$1.35 trillion: Total GDV for Q3$406 billion: Total U.S. GDV for Q3 (30 percent of the total)$908 billion: Total Global purchase volume2.4 billion: Mastercard and Maestro-branded cards in circulation worldwide","There were some concerns raised by a potential regulatory fine from the European Commission over its inter-regional interchange fees.Potential regulatory uncertainty aside, however, Mastercard CEO Ajay Banga was upbeat about the results ‰ÛÒ and what‰Ûªs next, particularly as it relates to securing an increasingly digital commerce-based world.As of Sept. 30, the company‰Ûªs customers had issued 2.4 billion Mastercard and Maestro-branded cards worldwide.Banga noted that while he thought it would be a mistake to immediately equate all instances of fraud increases with Equifax, security remains top of mind for the company.Mastercard noted that Netflix is the first company to have signed on to use its service.","['card', 'stock', 'banga', 'rises', 'billion', 'concerns', 'total', 'share', 'markets', 'regulatory', 'volume', 'mastercard', 'global', 'noted']",,,[],2017-11-01 04:00:55+00:00,https://www.pymnts.com/mastercard/2017/mastercard-stock-rises-in-q3-amid-cybersecurity-concerns/,,,,
Mastercard: SRC To Accelerate Digital Checkout,"It‰Ûªs easy to take for granted how consistent in-store payments with cards have become for consumers; there isn‰Ûªt a lot of mystery in that process for consumers, Jess Turner, EVP of Digital Payments and Labs of North America at Mastercard told PYMNTS in a recent conversation.In the physical environment, customers can more or less choose between the payment options they want, ‰ÛÏexpecting the security, consistency and ease of payments they‰Ûªre used to‰Ûù when they get to the digital world. However, they‰Ûªre not finding it, Turner said ‰ÛÓ or they‰Ûªre not finding it consistently enough.‰ÛÏWhen you are going through different merchant websites or apps, you can find they have all kinds of different ways to pay in their environment. Many sites ‰Û_ still [require] users [to] key in their full card information on their mobile device,‰Ûù she said.It‰Ûªs one of the biggest reasons Mastercard is supporting EMVCo‰Ûªs Secure Remote Commerce (SRC) framework, which was introduced in November of last year.Why SRCTurner said SRC will scale digital payments acceptance while replicating the consistent experience that people are used to in the physical world today.SRC, Turner emphasized, allows consumers to choose the payment method they wish to use since it is platform-agnostic.‰ÛÏWe think the next likely evolution is to one common single button in the digital world for consumers to use to checkout, working with the brands that give consumers choice in how they pay digitally. At the same time, they get a single digital experience,‰Ûù she said.Turner also added that SRC and a single ‰ÛÏbuy‰Ûù button will mitigate the friction associated with expired or stolen cards. SRC creates an encrypted token that outlives the card number and is, therefore, unimpacted by these problems.A Fully Tokenized WorldTurner also explained that the SRC framework will establish a more secure means of transacting digitally. Today, she said, 75 percent of the cards in the U.S. can be tokenized ‰ÛÓ something Turner describes as a ‰ÛÏtipping point, where a fully tokenized world can be reached.‰Ûù Building new payments infrastructure on top of tokens like SRC, she said, will move the payments ecosystem forward more quickly to both a consistent and secure digital payments experience.And one that is more predictable too, Turner emphasized. A tokenized world where account information is impossible for hackers to access will only increase the probability that consumers will feel comfortable leaving a card on file with a merchant ‰ÛÓ and, importantly, she said, with the ones they already feel comfortable using.For SRC to reach its full potential, Turner believes there needs to be a ‰ÛÏteam effort on the part of all of the payments ecosystem.‰Ûù Differentiation, she contended, shouldn‰Ûªt be about a standard, but about how to leverage a standard to build a better digital customer journey.‰ÛÏWe are really calling on merchants, acquirers, issuers, technology players ‰ÛÓ really everyone in the ecosystem to come together and give consumers what they want,‰Ûù Turner said. ‰ÛÏWe really want to see everyone drive ‰Û_ the EMVCo SRC standard so payments works across all browsers and devices. It‰Ûªs foundational, and we need everyone in the ecosystem to join hands and do what‰Ûªs right for the consumer.‰Ûù","It‰Ûªs one of the biggest reasons Mastercard is supporting EMVCo‰Ûªs Secure Remote Commerce (SRC) framework, which was introduced in November of last year.Why SRCTurner said SRC will scale digital payments acceptance while replicating the consistent experience that people are used to in the physical world today.SRC, Turner emphasized, allows consumers to choose the payment method they wish to use since it is platform-agnostic.‰ÛÏWe think the next likely evolution is to one common single button in the digital world for consumers to use to checkout, working with the brands that give consumers choice in how they pay digitally.‰ÛÏWe really want to see everyone drive ‰Û_ the EMVCo SRC standard so payments works across all browsers and devices.","['checkout', 'tokenized', 'digital', 'world', 'payments', 'turner', 'ecosystem', 'accelerate', 'theyre', 'consumers', 'standard', 'mastercard', 'src']",,,[],2018-04-18 17:05:46+00:00,https://www.pymnts.com/news/payment-methods/2018/mastercard-jess-turner-emvco-src/,,,,
Mastercard Launches Solution For Fleet Vehicles,"Mastercard has launched a new service that will automatically integrate fuel and maintenance data from a connected fleet car‰Ûªs dashboard into the payment process.The solution will eliminate the need for company car drivers to manually enter in their driver ID and odometer reading every time they use a fleet card to pay at the pump, which could lead to mistakes and overspending.‰ÛÏTechnology is unlocking new ways to deliver greater peace of mind,‰Ûù said Kiki Del Valle, senior vice president, Commerce for Every Device, Mastercard, in a press release. ‰ÛÏCombining digital payments capabilities with data from connected vehicles allows banks to give fleet managers a unique view into the inner workings of their business.‰ÛùWith the new service, fleet vehicles arrive at a gas station and automatically register vehicle data including location, odometer and fuel gauge readings when they arrive at the pump. Drivers will then be able to refuel without having to manually enter any data.And if a driver spends more on fuel than what is required by the car, both the fleet manager and the driver can receive an alert.

Credit card payments evolve beyond the mobile wallet,"Mobile wallets can make paying by credit or debit card seamless: Tap your phone at checkout and you're on your way. But mobile wallets are just the beginning. Payment networks and manufacturers are building payment functions into more devices ‰ÛÓ expanding your options as well as freeing up your hands.You could find yourself buying gas from the dashboard of your car, groceries from your refrigerator door or dinner by flashing a smile. And you won't even need your phone with you to make purchases on the go.MORE DEVICES ADD PAYMENT CAPABILITYPayment options already available or on the horizon include:‰ÛÓ Wearables. Connected ""smart"" accessories such as watches, bands and rings travel lighter than a phone. To use, the wearer holds a wrist or hand up to a contactless payment terminal. Visa tested these devices at the 2016 Rio Olympics to demonstrate possibilities, says Mark Jamison, global head of innovation and design at Visa.The market will determine, he says, if fashion designers want to ""embed payments into a ring or any other device."" One company privately testing similar tech is Token, whose smart ring ‰ÛÓ which performs a variety of functions, from opening doors to paying for purchases ‰ÛÓ has a waiting list.In 2017, payment capabilities branched out from Apple and Android smartwatches to some Fitbit and Garmin fitness devices, meaning more people could leave their phone behind while working out.By the end of this year, Visa expects merchants to have tap-to-pay capability at 50 percent of U.S. locations where face-to-face transactions take place.‰ÛÓ Virtual assistants. When voice payments are enabled on virtual assistants like Amazon Echo and Google Home, you can multitask and take care of ""errands"" in the moment with verbal commands.CONNECTED DEVICES WILL BE THE NORMConsider the number of mobile applications with saved payment information on your mobile device. In the future, you could free up some data and save a little battery life by using other connected devices:‰ÛÓ Cars. Visa and Mastercard are working with manufacturers to embed options in car models. Manufacturers are also testing ways to pay for gas, groceries, takeout, metered parking and other things from screens on vehicle dashboards.""It's still early, but we are focused on bringing that to life this year, to have the ability for you, as the driver, to not just order from one type of merchant,"" says Stephane Wyper, senior vice president of new commerce partnerships and commercialization at Mastercard.‰ÛÓ Appliances. Appliances will get smarter in the future. A glimpse of what's possible: Samsung's Family Hub refrigerator, which lets you order groceries from the Groceries by Mastercard app; Whirlpool's Smart Dishwasher, which, when synced with an Amazon account, can estimate when you're low on detergent and order it automatically.‰ÛÓ Your body. Going totally device-free could also become an option. Biometric payments make it possible to pay by voice, face, iris scan or fingerprint. It's not a big stretch from the biometric authentication currently used by some phones or applications.""The technology itself has been around for a while, but consumers were skeptical of it,"" Jamison says. They've since become accustomed to authenticating using a fingerprint via phone, and their preference has shifted from user ID and password to biometrics, he says.In January 2018, CaliBurger restaurants launched a pay-by-face pilot program in Pasadena, California. Customers pay for their order by smiling for the camera and entering the three-digit number from the back of a credit card.MORE OPTIONS, FEWER PASSWORDSCurrent devices, apps and websites generally each require a separate profile with payment details. In the future, you could keep payment information in one place and sync it to all devices.In 2017, Mastercard launched Consumer Control to offer consumers a central view of their cards across different channels. With access through their issuer, cardholders can add their cards to their favorite shopping sites and devices from one location.The forecast for the future includes more convenient payment options. Visa estimates that 50 billion smart devices will be connected to the internet by 2020.Merchants won't begin accepting payments from everything overnight; for certain devices it may take a few years. For now, you can start exploring the options outside of your mobile wallet.This article was provided to The Associated Press by the personal finance website NerdWallet.

"Which of these 2 stocks can turn out to be absolute gem? ‰ÛÒ PepsiCo, Inc. (PEP), Mastercard Incorporated (MA) ‰ÛÒ Stock News Gazette","The shares of PepsiCo, Inc. have decreased by more than -18.69% this year alone. The shares recently went down by -0.42% or -$0.41 and now trades at $97.51. The shares of Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), has jumped by 25.79% year to date as of 05/18/2018. The shares currently trade at $190.40 and have been able to report a change of -1.53% over the past one week.The stock of PepsiCo, Inc. and Mastercard Incorporated were two of the most active stocks on Friday. Investors seem to be very interested in what happens to the stocks of these two companies but do investors favor one over the other? We will analyze the growth, profitability, risk, valuation, and insider trends of both companies and see which one investors prefer.When a company is able to grow consistently in terms of earnings at a high compound rate have the highest likelihood of creating value for its shareholders over time. Analysts have predicted that PEP will grow it‰Ûªs earning at a 7.69% annual rate in the next 5 years. This is in contrast to MA which will have a positive growth at a 21.48% annual rate. This means that the higher growth rate of MA implies a greater potential for capital appreciation over the years.Growth alone cannot be used to see if the company will be valuable. Shareholders will be the losers if a company invest in ventures that aren‰Ûªt profitable enough to support upbeat growth. In order for us to accurately measure profitability and return, we will be using the EBITDA margin and Return on Investment (ROI), which balances the difference in capital structure. PEP has an EBITDA margin of 20.06%, this implies that the underlying business of MA is more profitable. The ROI of PEP is 16.40% while that of MA is 44.00%. These figures suggest that MA ventures generate a higher ROI than that of PEP.The value of a stock is ultimately determined by the amount of cash flow that the investors have available. Over the last 12 months, PEP‰Ûªs free cash flow per share is a negative -4.4, while that of MA is positive 6.6.The ability of a company to meet up with its short-term obligations and be able to clear its longer-term debts is measured using Liquidity and leverage ratios. The current ratio for PEP is 1.30 and that of MA is 1.60. This implies that it is easier for PEP to cover its immediate obligations over the next 12 months than MA. The debt ratio of PEP is 4.00 compared to 1.13 for MA. PEP can be able to settle its long-term debts and thus is a lower financial risk than MA.PEP currently trades at a forward P/E of 15.95, a P/B of 12.73, and a P/S of 2.17 while MA trades at a forward P/E of 25.76, a P/B of 35.06, and a P/S of 14.97. This means that looking at the earnings, book values and sales basis, PEP is the cheaper one. It is very obvious that earnings are the most important factors to investors, thus analysts are most likely to place their bet on the P/E.The mistake some people make is that they think a cheap stock has more value to it. In order to know the value of a stock, there is need to compare its current price to its likely trading price in the future. The price of PEP is currently at a -17.52% to its one-year price target of 118.22. Looking at its rival pricing, MA is at a -2.9% relative to its price target of 196.09.When looking at the investment recommendation on say a scale of 1 to 5 (1 being a strong buy, 3 a hold, and 5 a sell), PEP is given a 2.40 while 1.70 placed for MA. This means that analysts are more bullish on the outlook for PEP stocks.Short interest or otherwise called the percentage of a stock‰Ûªs tradable shares currently being shorted is another data that investors use to get a handle on sentiment. The short ratio for PEP is 1.63 while that of MA is just 1.73. This means that analysts are more bullish on the forecast for PEP stock.ConclusionThe stock of PepsiCo, Inc. defeats that of Mastercard Incorporated when the two are compared, with PEP taking 6 out of the total factors that were been considered. PEP happens to be more profitable, generates a higher ROI, has higher cash flow per share, higher liquidity and has a lower financial risk. When looking at the stock valuation, PEP is the cheaper one on an earnings, book value and sales basis. Finally, the sentiment signal for PEP is better on when it is viewed on short interest.","The stock of PepsiCo, Inc. and Mastercard Incorporated were two of the most active stocks on Friday.These figures suggest that MA ventures generate a higher ROI than that of PEP.This means that analysts are more bullish on the forecast for PEP stock.PEP happens to be more profitable, generates a higher ROI, has higher cash flow per share, higher liquidity and has a lower financial risk.When looking at the stock valuation, PEP is the cheaper one on an earnings, book value and sales basis.","['shares', 'stock', 'value', 'investors', 'gem', 'rate', 'higher', 'incorporated', 'turn', 'pepsico', 'gazette', 'ma', 'roi', 'stocks', 'price', 'mastercard', 'pep']",,,[],5/21/18 0:00,https://stocknewsgazette.com/2018/05/21/which-of-these-2-stocks-can-turn-out-to-be-absolute-gem-pepsico-inc-pep-mastercard-incorporated-ma/,,,,

Asda petrol pump charge ‰ÛÒ what is the å£99 earmarked fee for paying at the pump and has it been scrapped?,"PETROL stations started issuing å£99 earmarked checks to see if drivers have enough funds to pay for a full fuel tank thanks to new policies brought in by Visa and Mastercard.But ASDA has now suspended the charge after a backlash from customers. Here's the lowdown on thr row.PA:Press Association The higher charge is the brainchild of Visa and Mastercard to stop people spending money they don't haveWhat is the å£99 earmarked fee for paying at the pump?When buying pay at the pump petrol you have to put your chip and PIN in first before the fuel is dispensed.A ""pre-authorisation"" check takes place - this takes money from your account which is essentially put aside to pay for your petrol or diesel once you have finished.Since the scheme first started most supermarkets would only charge å£1 to your account to check for funds, and that money would be refunded once the transaction went through.In fact, Tesco still runs their pay at pump system with the å£1 charge.But, thanks to new rules from Mastercard and Visa other petrol stations such as Asda and Sainsbury's are starting to use a much larger figure.Asda is trialling the figure at å£99 in a handful of stores before a wider roll out - which shocked driver Jade Louise when she saw the figure on her account statement after filling up her motor.Jade slammed the store for the fee which left her å£99 down for 2-3 days and other drivers have vowed to boycott the store for petrol after seeing her post.Similarly, Sainsbury's can charge an earmarked fee from å£1 to å£99 depending on how much drivers have in their account.PA:Press Association Most drivers will have a higher earmarked charge than the cost of the fuel actually dispensedHas the charge been scrapped?The earmarked charge has been halted by ASDA after it saw a backlash from customers over it and said they had not realised that some banks didn't refund the check charge straight away.Speaking to MoneySavingExpert the superstore said: ""We always want to do the right thing for our customers, which is why we have made the decision to suspend Visa and Mastercard‰Ûªs pre-authorisation transaction trail.""The intention of Visa and MasterCard in this trial was to ensure customers had sufficient funds in their account to pay for their fuel, and the å£99 would be immediately released back to customers by their bank.""Whilst we have received very few complaints about this process, until we can be given assurance that all banks are able to comply with the Visa and Mastercard rule change, we cannot continue to implement this change and risk harming our customers‰Ûª trust in us.‰ÛùHowever other supermarkets who are believed to also issue an earmarked charge have not said if they are also suspending the scheme.PA:Press Association ASDA said they didn't want to 'risk harming' customers' trustDo I get the money back if a earmarked charge is made?The supermarkets say that they don't get the money from the earmarked fee.Mastercard argue that the higher charge has been introduced to make sure drivers can't buy more fuel than they can afford.They added that if drivers don't have the required fund to meet the high figure, then petrol stations can check exactly what funds the customer has available and then dispense a lower value of fuel.Mastercard said: ""While some customers may see a request for a higher amount than the fuel they bought - perhaps on their mobile banking app - these funds are not taken from their account.""Only the value of the petrol dispensed is withdrawn.‰ÛùThis means the earmarked charge amount goes back into your account once the payment for the petrol has been processed.PA:Press Association Supermarkets claim they never get the money and that it is ring fenced by the banksDo I need an overdraft to use pay at pump?Some banks have taken to blocking transactions at pay at pump petrol stations for basic account holders - which covers anyone who doesn't have an overdraft.However, the block isn't enforced by all banks and most that do enforce it only do so for petrol stations that haven't been updated to follow Visa and Mastercard's new guidelines.According to moneysavingexpert.com Halifax, HSBC, Lloyds, Natwest, RBS, Nationwide and Bank of Scotland all block transactions at pumps which don't use the higher earmarked charge, if you don't have an overdraft facility.LATEST IN MONEY GOLDEN ARCHES Fancy a Big Mac on Bank Holiday Monday?

"Co-Op, Mastercard launch scan and go technology","First self-check out then scan as you shop now Co-Op has introduced scan and go, removing the use of tills altogether for a better shopping experience.The Co-op has revealed it will soon rollout new technology within its stores that allows customers to scan and pay for products using just their smartphone.Teaming up with Mastercard, the food retailer hopes to compete with tech giant Amazon after the launch of its ‰Û÷Amazon Go‰Ûª store. The technology for Co-op will allow customers to scan an item on their phone and leave without the need to stop at a till, in one frictionless experience.Using the technology, shoppers simply scan products using the Co-op app on their phone as they browse through the store. Once they have finished customers simply click ‰Û÷check out‰Ûª using pre-stored payment details within the app with Mastercard Masterpass, then happily leave the store.The technology will benefit those shoppers in a hurry, according to the company, enabling them to get in and out of the store with their goods in a short amount of time. Those customers who frequently shop at the Co-Op will benefit from savings, as the app records the information in their membership account. When customers buy a co-op brand they are given a 5% reward to their account, with another 1% going to charitable causes.Elliott Goldenberg, head, digital payments, Mastercard UK, says: ‰ÛÏWith the Co-op we are bringing our online and mobile capability ‰ÛÒ Masterpass ‰ÛÒ into the physical store, and offering consumers who want a fast and frictionless buying experience, a secure and reliable way to pay.‰ÛùCo-op is still in the final stages of the app trial at a store in Manchester, which is not open to the public. However, there is expected to be another trial at Microsoft‰Ûªs UK headquarters in Reading before a public roll out.Despite the obvious benefits surrounding the technology, it has brought concerns over artificial intelligence (AI) and automation taking over jobs to the surface again. Many workers are concerned that the technology could rule out the need for tills completely, leaving people out of a job to technology once again.The Co-op, however, has insisted the technology will not take over jobs and instead compliment the current ways of shopping and paying.Matthew Speight, the Co-op director of retail support, said: ‰ÛÏIt is all about consumer choices and convenience. We recognise there are many communities where customers pop in to their local Co-op and enjoy a friendly chat ‰ÛÒ it is all part of the service. Whereas for others, perhaps with a train to catch or on a school run, every second can count as consumers seek increased convenience.‰ÛùThe Co-op has said it expects to start delivering the technology to the public as early as the summer.","First self-check out then scan as you shop now Co-Op has introduced scan and go, removing the use of tills altogether for a better shopping experience.The Co-op has revealed it will soon rollout new technology within its stores that allows customers to scan and pay for products using just their smartphone.Teaming up with Mastercard, the food retailer hopes to compete with tech giant Amazon after the launch of its ‰Û÷Amazon Go‰Ûª store.The technology for Co-op will allow customers to scan an item on their phone and leave without the need to stop at a till, in one frictionless experience.Using the technology, shoppers simply scan products using the Co-op app on their phone as they browse through the store.","['launch', 'app', 'coop', 'customers', 'uk', 'technology', 'scan', 'using', 'public', 'mastercard', 'store']",,,['April Slattery'],2018-03-07 11:49:29+01:00,https://www.cbronline.com/news/co-op-mastercard-launch-scan-go-technology,,,,

"How Mastercard, IBM plan to reinvent security under GDPR","Mastercard and IBM have founded a company with a very narrow goal: to help organizations scramble their data to thwart hackers and comply with Europe's General Data Protection Regulation.They established Truata in Ireland as a trust to provide a new standard in data hosting and anonymization conceived by Mastercard that will help businesses build a security layer using methods only they know. The process falls in line with pseudonymization, another process under GDPR in which businesses handling European consumer data would never keep all of the personal or payment credential data for one person in one place. Rather, parts of it would be stored in different silos on a network.Bloomberg News""Data anonymization ensures that data can never be attributed to a specific individual,"" said Truata CEO Felix Marx, who recently served as executive vice president of services in Asia-Pacific for Mastercard.The European Union has set May 25 as the deadline for GDPR compliance. Any company that deals with European customers has to comply with GDPR or risk hefty fines. The foundation of the regulation rests on the European Union's contention that consumers ""own"" their data, not the companies in possession of it. The regulation affects any company that handles payments or personal information.Truata's process for anonymization starts with the data-driven business client ""de-identifying"" the data using a methodology known only to them. That data is transferred to Truata, where any remaining identifiers are removed and replaced with a token.That data is transferred to Truata's data vault, where the token is replaced with another token known only to Truata. The data is then used to perform analysis for each customer, Marx said.It's a deep security process that includes measures like ""noise"" and ""perturbing data"" techniques that are well known to data scientists and essentially replace portions of actual data content through a statistical process. It preserves the analytical value of the data, while preventing the ability to convert it back to its original form.Because GDPR requires businesses to secure data in certain ways, as well as honor the premise that a European consumer has the only say over whether it can be used for any other marketing or sales purposes, many observers feel the European Union regulation could ultimately prevent major data breaches.""GDPR will undoubtedly lead to data protection that reduces the incidence of big breaches, even in the U.S.,"" said Al Pascual, research director and head of fraud and security for Javelin Strategy & Research. ""Consider that the many, if not most, medium to large enterprises do business in Europe.""Though not all of these businesses will take the same steps, anonymizing and pseudonmynizing sensitive customer data will frustrate criminals, driving a shift in their behavior, Pascual said.""Other data will still be at risk, including intellectual property and business financial data, meaning we can expect ransomware to continue, if not increase,"" he added. ""Criminals are going to look for ways to get paid and if they can't compromise and sell it to misuse personal identifiable information, they are going to pile it into other schemes.""In the past month, Truata and IBM began providing cloud, analytics and cognitive computing capabilities to data protection measures Truata will develop with clients.""The GDPR sets a new standard for data privacy,"" Truata's Marx said. ""Our conversations with regulators, potential customers and other entities impacted by GDPR have shown that when it comes to analytics and the need to have compliance with the GDPR, many organizations have not yet started to consider the need for anonymized data.""Indeed, Smart Insights reported that only 6% of companies it surveyed said they were fully prepared, while 21% indicated they were close, but nearly 50% said they were aware of the looming deadline but hadn't started compliance work yet.Truata is working to close that gap dramatically in the next several weeks.""Organizations need to be more proactive in the way they manage all of their personal data ‰ÛÓ employee, customer and proprietary ‰ÛÓ to ensure they remain compliant with GDPR,"" Marx said.Many organizations have underestimated the measures that will be required to comply, Marx added. ""Consent management solutions, designated data privacy officers, special controls on data access, and new legal bases for use of data will all change the way they manage and use data,"" he said.Regardless of which companies are prepared to comply or not, the GDPR brings on a significant change in how payments companies will handle European consumer data.""Of course, there will still be a long tail of smaller U.S. businesses that won't take the same steps to protect customer data because they don't do business overseas,"" Javelin's Pascual said. ""It's simply, they don't care about complying, which will make them more attractive targets in this post-GDPR future.""Currently, a U.S. credit card processor who has locked down and protected a consumer's payment card and personal data would essentially be able to store that data forever.Under GDPR, a European consumer could request that it be stored only for future payment reference for a period of time, or be taken off the database completely. The data could not be used for any other purpose without consent.","The data is then used to perform analysis for each customer, Marx said.""Organizations need to be more proactive in the way they manage all of their personal data ‰ÛÓ employee, customer and proprietary ‰ÛÓ to ensure they remain compliant with GDPR,"" Marx said.Regardless of which companies are prepared to comply or not, the GDPR brings on a significant change in how payments companies will handle European consumer data.Currently, a U.S. credit card processor who has locked down and protected a consumer's payment card and personal data would essentially be able to store that data forever.Under GDPR, a European consumer could request that it be stored only for future payment reference for a period of time, or be taken off the database completely.","['businesses', 'customer', 'mastercard', 'process', 'ibm', 'personal', 'plan', 'truata', 'consumer', 'data', 'gdpr', 'reinvent', 'marx', 'european', 'security']",,,['David Heun'],2018-04-11 00:01:13.713000-04:00,https://www.paymentssource.com/news/how-mastercard-and-ibms-truata-plans-to-reinvent-security-under-gdpr,,,,
The 3 Best Credit Cards for American Airlines Flyers,"Forbes has partnered with The Points Guy for our coverage of credit card products. Forbes and The Points Guy receive a commission from Citi.American Airline's passengers have plenty of credit card options to choose from. Unlike Delta and United which each have exclusive card agreements with a single bank (Amex and Chase respectively), American Airlines cards are issues by both Citi and Barclays. Today I'll take a look at the best options available to AA fliers, whether you're looking to chase elite status, boost your mileage balance, or simply enjoy some premium perks.Photo by Shutterstock.comCitiCiti is the main issuer of AA credit cards, currently offering one personal card, one business card, and one premium card. Here's a quick overview of the different Citi cards:Card Sign-up Bonus Annual Fee Bonus Categories First checked Bag Free Citi / AAdvantage Platinum Select World Elite Mastercard 60,000 miles after spending $3,000 in the first 3 months $99 (waived first year) 2x on AA purchases, restaurants, gas stations 4 companions CitiBusiness / AAdvantage Platinum Select World Mastercard 70,000 miles after spending $4,000 in the first 3 months $95 (waived first year) 2x on AA purchases, telecom, rental cars, gas stations 4 companions Citi / AAdvantage Executive World Elite Mastercard 50,000 miles after spending $5,000 in the first 3 months $450 2x on AA purchases 8 companionsIn addition, all 3 Citi AA cards also come with priority boarding and no foreign transaction fees. So which card is right for you?Citi AAdvantage Platinum Select World Elite MastercardOne of the most popular AA cards, the Citi Platinum Select World Elite Mastercard just got a very consumer friendly upgrade. The card now has an elevated sign-up bonus of 60,000 miles after spending $3,000 in 3 months, which I value at ~$840. With a much lower annual fee than the Executive card and perks like priority boarding and a free checked bag, this card is perfect for casual AA fliers who aren't concerned with elite status.CitiBusiness AAdvantage Platinum Select World MastercardAlthough the business version of the Platinum Select card has a higher minimum spending requirement, you'll get an extra 10,000 miles (~$140) for completing it. The additional bonus categories of telecom purchases and rental cars are especially business friendly, but this card is also good for business owners looking to get/stay under Chase's ""5/24"" rule. While the inquiry will show up on your personal credit report, the account itself won't, meaning it won't take up one of your 5 valuable slots with Chase.Citi AAdvantage Executive World Elite MastercardIt's disappointing that the most expensive card in Citi's AA portfolio has both the lowest sign-up bonus and the highest minimum spend requirement. While the $450 annual fee is tough to swallow, there are several compelling reasons to consider this card. Executive cardholders receive an Admirals Club membership, granting you access no matter what airline you're flying or what cabin you're traveling in. Authorized users get membership as well, and you can even bring two guests for free. If you're chasing elite status, this card also offers 10,000 EQMs after spending $40,000 in a calendar year.Which Card To PickIn order to pick which of these cards is right for you, you first need to figure out what you're looking for. Casual travelers would be best served by the Citi Platinum Select World Elite Mastercard. This card is also great to keep long term, as it offer a 10% rebate on AA mileage redemptions up to 10,000 miles a year (per AAdvantage account, so this can't be stacked across multiple cards). In my mind this easily justifies the $99 annual fee.While I am intrigued by the idea of earning EQMs and EQDs towards status, there are other cards I'd rather put that heavy spending on. That being said, if you fly a lot with AA and are feeling burned by the recent addition of revenue requirements to qualify for status, the Aviator Red or Silver cards from Barclays can help you reach your goal faster.This content is not provided by Citi.

Mastercard Beats Street As Cross Currency Surges,"Mastercard beat estimates on Wednesday (May 2) as the company showed results that reflected higher spending on both credit and debit cards through the first quarter, as well as cross-border volumes that surged by double digits.The company said that worldwide gross dollar volume gained 14 percent to $1.4 trillion, and, as CFO Martina Hund-Mejean stated on the conference call with analysts, most regions saw double-digit growth.The headline numbers showed earnings of $1.50 a share on an adjusted basis, easily outpacing the Street at $1.24. The net revenue number of $3.6 billion, up 31 percent year on year and 27 percent in constant currency terms, was better than the $3.3 billion consensus.In the United States, gross dollar volume was up 10 percent, gaining a percent from last quarter. Within that number, credit was up 9 percent, and debit 12 percent. Internationally, volume growth was 16 percent, with tailwinds from Asia Pacific and Europe.Of particular note was cross-border volume, which gained 21 percent as measured in local currency, and driven by Europe. That growth has moderated slightly through April 28 and stands at about 19 percent, said management.In remarks made during the post-earnings conference call with analysts, Ajay Banga, CEO, said that excluding impacts of accounting changes and acquisitions, net revenue growth was up 20 percent year over year.In terms of macro outlook, said the executive, the company continues to see growth but is eyeing the movement toward central banks to rein in fiscal stimulus.Broken down by region, he continued, in North America, the environment is a healthy one where unemployment is low, while consumer confidence and retail spending are strong. Beyond U.S. borders, the environment is sanguine, with some retail spending growth in the U.K. (though Brexit remains a concern), marked by some deceleration. Latin America continues to show recovery.‰ÛÏMost of the economies in Asia continue trending positively [with] more stable oil prices, and I think a number of government initiatives have driven some improvement in the Middle East and Africa region,‰Ûù Banga told analysts. ‰ÛÏIf you put that together, we expect the global economy to remain positive absent any significant impact from geopolitics or trade risks.‰ÛùLater in the call, Hund-Mejean offered some color on the international front, remarking that ‰ÛÏwe‰Ûªre seeing very solid spend in the U.K. domestically. We see solid double-digit cross-border growth outbound of the U.K. as well as inbound into the U.K.‰ÛÏSo, we‰Ûªre seeing at the moment no clouds on the horizon, even though we are obviously worried about Brexit,‰Ûù she continued. ‰ÛÏWe see very solid growth in Eastern Europe showing up. In Asia Pacific, what we‰Ûªre really seeing is that Australia is coming back a little bit, and we‰Ûªre also seeing some healthy growth, it‰Ûªs like in the high single-digit rate, from a cross-border perspective in China,‰Ûù she told analysts.Expanding a bit on China, Banga reiterated recent corporate efforts, where Mastercard has applied in that country for a domestic license with a joint venture.Against that solid macro backdrop, the double-digit transaction growth in both credit and debit was illustrated by management on the call.Amid specific initiatives and partnerships, Banga called out the fact that Kroger is converting cards to Mastercard on the heels of its relationship, which was announced last year. In addition, he spotlighted Mastercard‰Ûªs ongoing efforts with PayPal, where Mastercard is the exclusive network for the latter‰Ûªs first consumer debit card in the United States, which lets customers access funds to shop online and withdraw cash globally at ATMs.The company is making progress with Vocalink, he said, with RFPs out in the field. As illumination of the potential of faster payments, he offered the example of the PromptPay mobile system in Thailand, where the international payments function is underpinned by Vocalink. As of April of this year, said Banga, 14 million customers have signed up, with 170 million transactions logged cumulatively since January 2017, and $16 billion in business and consumer payments seen in the past six months.Speaking broadly of digital inroads, said Banga, ‰ÛÏYou heard us recently announce our support of the EMVCo standards for simple and unified payments. When people shop online and in-app, they expect the same convenience and security that they have in store. And just like the single acceptance terminal in a physical store, we believe there should be one common checkout button in the digital world.‰Ûù As many as 75 percent of cards from the company are enabled to be tokenized, he said.Hund-Mejean said the company‰Ûªs eCommerce business grew 25 percent year on year. She offered guidance on the remainder of 2018, where revenues should be in the high teens, percentage wise, as should organic growth. Cross-border growth may, she said ‰ÛÏmoderate somewhat‰Ûù with a falloff in crypto wallet funding ‰ÛÒ to the tune of 1 percent impact seen in the fourth quarter and one percentage point in the first quarter.","The headline numbers showed earnings of $1.50 a share on an adjusted basis, easily outpacing the Street at $1.24.In the United States, gross dollar volume was up 10 percent, gaining a percent from last quarter.Internationally, volume growth was 16 percent, with tailwinds from Asia Pacific and Europe.Of particular note was cross-border volume, which gained 21 percent as measured in local currency, and driven by Europe.‰ÛÏWe see very solid growth in Eastern Europe showing up.","['crossborder', 'street', 'banga', 'cross', 'seeing', 'surges', 'payments', 'company', 'currency', 'solid', 'quarter', 'beats', 'growth', 'volume', 'mastercard']",,,[],2018-05-03 04:03:18+00:00,https://www.pymnts.com/mastercard/2018/earnings-q1-stocks-wall-street-cross-border/,,,,

Why the U.S. Is Still a Big Growth Market for Visa and Mastercard,"Shares of Visa (NYSE:V) and Mastercard (NYSE:MA) have soared since their IPOs, thanks to a general shift in payments from cash to cards, as well as a dominant position in the U.S. payments ecosystem. But while investors look to emerging markets as drivers of growth going forward, data from a Federal Reserve study show that these two payments businesses have massive growth potential even in their most developed markets.Here's why Visa and Mastercard can continue to drive profit growth from U.S. consumer spending.1. Online retail drives card spendingThe changing retail landscape is a boon for payments companies like Visa and Mastercard since online shoppers are much more likely than in-store spenders to pay by card. In 2016, so-called remote transactions in which a card is not present in physical form grew faster than in-person debit and credit payments.Card Type Growth in Remote Transactions Growth in Total Transaction Value of Remote Payments Non-prepaid debit cards 14.9% 8.9% General purpose credit cards 16.6% 9.6%It's difficult to handicap who will win and lose as more goods and services are sold online, but it's clear that the payment networks are obvious winners of online retail, since cash and checks take a much smaller share of total online spending compared to spending in brick-and-mortar stores.At its 2017 investor day, Visa pointed out that it had roughly a 23% share of in-person spending on personal consumption expenditures (PCE) in the United States. It estimated that it had 47% of U.S. PCE spending online. As retail moves online, the payment networks simply win.2. Credit cards are taking shareWhen it comes to debit or credit, Visa and Mastercard prefer that you use credit. That's because credit card fees are typically more lucrative than fees on debit cards for the payment networks and the banks that issue the cards.Card Type Number of Transactions Total Value Non-prepaid debit cards 6.8% 6.1% General purpose credit cards 10.5% 7%Visa and Mastercard make money by providing the toll roads on which payments and data travel, so credit conditions only have an indirect impact on their top and bottom lines. That said, loosening credit conditions and a competitive credit card market are giving lift to Visa and Mastercard, given that a purchase charged is better for the networks than a purchase debited from a checking account.Nearly a decade after the financial crisis, banks are once again opening credit card accounts for people who have less than stellar credit. Consumers with FICO scores of 659 or lower opened roughly 7.7 million credit card accounts more than they closed in 2016, the third straight year in which new account openings topped account closures.3. Private-label cards lose to co-brand cardsPrivate-label card companies like Synchrony Financial and Alliance Data Systems have grown by helping retailers issue their own store cards that skip Visa's and Mastercard's networks. Retailers push these private-label cards to consumers because they can avoid costly processing fees, collect more data about their customers, and share in the profits earned when their card-carrying customers carry a balance.Despite their advantages for retailers, the number of payments conducted on private-label cards grew by 7.5% in 2016, but the total value of the payments actually declined by 1.6%. In other words, store cards are winning small transactions but losing share of larger transactions.Visa and Mastercard have been winning over stores that might otherwise create their own private-label cards. So-called co-brand cards, which are cards that carry a brand name but can be used anywhere, are becoming more popular. Visa won big with several retail card programs, including Costco's Anywhere Visa and Amazon's Prime Rewards Visa card, which is a compelling alternative to Amazon's store card issued by Synchrony Financial.Cards accounted for roughly $6 trillion of total payment volume in the United States in 2016, putting the U.S. far ahead of most of the world when it comes to the shift from cash to plastic. But there's more to these growth stories than the shift to plastic. Visa and Mastercard can still find profit growth even at home, thanks to a shift toward e-commerce, growing credit card share, and wins in co-brand cards.","Here's why Visa and Mastercard can continue to drive profit growth from U.S. consumer spending.2.

Why This Analyst Likes PayPal and American Express,"Every day, Wall Street analysts upgrade some stocks, downgrade others, and ""initiate coverage"" on a few more. But do these analysts even know what they're talking about? Today, we're taking one high-profile Wall Street pick and putting it under the microscope...Would you like to pay for that with Mastercard (NYSE:MA), Visa (NYSE:V), or PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL)?That's the question Sears Outlet's website asked me earlier this week. And here's the funny bit: I actually wanted to pay with my new American Express (NYSE:AXP) card, but because of a coding glitch on Sears' website, the field wasn't big enough to enter all the required numbers. To work around that snafu, I was forced to add my AmEx card to my PayPal account, then charge my new dishwasher to the AmEx card on PayPal.So I ended up choosing PayPal over Mastercard and Visa after all -- and I'm not the only one.Identifying the playersLast night, analysts at Swiss megabanker UBS announced they were initiating coverage on four of the world's biggest payment processors: Mastercard, Visa, PayPal, and American Express.Running down the contenders, UBS determined that Visa and Mastercard would both benefit from ""sustained secular trends of growth in personal consumption expenditures and increasing adoption of electronic payments,"" according to a write-up on TheFly.com. By UBS' estimation, both Mastercard and Visa will likely enjoy ""annual revenue growth rates of up to 11% beyond"" fiscal year 2018. Accordingly, the analyst believes both stocks will rise in value over the next year, with Visa going from $130 a share to about $141 (8.5% growth) and Mastercard rising from $191 a share to $205 (7.3% growth).Both stocks thus have respectable profit potential. Neither one is spectacular, however. UBS rates both Mastercard and Visa only neutral.Picking PayPal to winNot so with PayPal.Positing a $90 target price for the online payments specialist, UBS sees 15% profit potential in PayPal stock. As UBS explains, PayPal is expected to benefit from ""sustained volume growth"" among its ""core constituencies"" -- presumably, even better growth than the analyst sees at Mastercard and Visa. Additionally, merchants are driving demand for its payment processing and gateway services, says UBS. According to the analyst, around the globe, some 94% of small and medium enterprises that UBS has surveyed plan to increase their acceptance of electronic payments.Thus, while PayPal stock may cost a bit more than Mastercard or Visa (when valued on P/E), the company's superior growth and profit potential has UBS thinking PayPal is more of a buy than either of the two premier credit card names.And American Express to win even biggerBut there's only one stock that UBS calls its ""top pick among Payment Networks"": American Express.This is actually a curious pronouncement, because by UBS' own admission, AmEx stock is only likely to hit $115 a share over the next 12 months -- a 14% increase from today's share price of $101 and change, and thus a bit lower than the profit potential UBS foresees for PayPal.So why does UBS prefer AmEx?UBS forecasts ""positive"" trends across the payments industry, predicting ""robust growth"" and a ""total addressable market for electronic payments"" estimated at $95 trillion annually. With regard to AmEx in particular, UBS expects the company to show ""accelerating discount volumes and loan growth."" Such a move could potentially bring the fees AmEx charges more in line with its competitors, and increase acceptance of AmEx's traditionally more expensive cards by retailers (as explained in this article on AmEx's Q4 earnings report earlier this year).UBS believes these moves will drive earnings growth at AmEx, and support ""a high-level stability of profitability,"" which will permit AmEx to ""beat and raise"" estimates all year long.Which stock should investors prefer (if any)?So that's why UBS prefers AmEx over PayPal -- and both AmEx and PayPal over Mastercard and Visa. But which of these stocks should investors prefer?All four, it must be admitted, look pretty pricey in terms of P/E. At just under 33 times earnings, Visa stock is actually the cheapest of the four companies named. Mastercard costs 52 times earnings, and PayPal (after a quick bump higher on last night's UBS note) now costs 55 times earnings.American Express stock meanwhile, sells for 34 times earnings. That's nearly as cheap as Visa, which may help explain UBS' fondness for the stock. That being said, most analysts surveyed by S&P Global Market Intelligence still see American Express growing its earnings only 10% annually over the next five years. That's roughly half as fast as the growth rates most analysts project for the other three payments processing stocks (20% for MasterCard, 19% for PayPal, and 18.5% for Visa).If you ask me, Visa, with the lowest P/E of the bunch and a projected growth rate nearly as high as the highest, is closest to being ""buyable"" at a PEG ratio of 1.8 -- but to be perfectly honest, I don't see any of these stocks being cheap enough to buy at today's high prices.","Identifying the playersLast night, analysts at Swiss megabanker UBS announced they were initiating coverage on four of the world's biggest payment processors: Mastercard, Visa, PayPal, and American Express.Positing a $90 target price for the online payments specialist, UBS sees 15% profit potential in PayPal stock.And American Express to win even biggerBut there's only one stock that UBS calls its ""top pick among Payment Networks"": American Express.So that's why UBS prefers AmEx over PayPal -- and both AmEx and PayPal over Mastercard and Visa.At just under 33 times earnings, Visa stock is actually the cheapest of the four companies named.","['visa', 'express', 'stock', 'american', 'paypal', 'stocks', 'payments', 'amex', 'ubs', 'likes', 'analyst', 'growth', 'mastercard', 'earnings']",,,['Rich Smith'],5/18/18 0:00,https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/05/18/why-this-analyst-likes-paypal-and-american-express.aspx,,,,
"Suitable Value Stocks? ‰ÛÒ The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (BK), Mastercard Incorporated (MA)","Investors making a wish list of stocks to watch should take a look at The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (NYSE:BK). The stock is offering a price-to-sales ratio of 3.64. This situation may create an opportunity where long term players can win with either market bounce, or when long-term value is realized. The broad The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation industry has an average P/S ratio of 7.31, which is significantly better than the sector‰Ûªs 328.58. In the past 13-year record, this ratio went down as low as 1.46 and as high as 4.82. Also, it is up from 57% of the total 935 rivals across the globe.BK traded at an unexpectedly low level on 05/16/2018 when the stock experienced a 0.3% gain to a closing price of $57.06. The company saw 3.12 million shares trade hands over the course of the day. Given that its average daily volume over the 30 days has been 4.87 million shares a day, this signifies a pretty significant change over the norm.We have seen a 9.33% rise in the stock price over the last 30 days and a 1.93% increase over the past 3 months. Overall, the share price is up 5.94% so far this year. Additionally, BK had a day price range of $56.6 to $57.26.In order to determine directional movement, the 50-day and 200-day moving averages for The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (NYSE:BK) are $53.8 and $54.42. Given that liquidity is king in short-term, BK is a stock with 1.01 billion shares outstanding that normally trades 1.22% of its float. The stock price recently experienced a 5-day gain of 0.35% with 1.02 average true range (ATR). BK has a beta of 1.21 and RSI is 63.56.Investors also need to beware of the Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) valuations. The stock trades on a P/S of 15.04, which suggests that the shares are not attractive compared with peers. The broad Mastercard Incorporated industry has an average P/S ratio of 7.46, which is significantly worse than the sector‰Ûªs 2.7. In the past 13-year record, this ratio went down as low as 3.27 and as high as 15.44. Also, it is down from 86% of the total 414 rivals across the globe.Mastercard Incorporated by far traveled 66.49% versus a 1-year low price of $115.55. The share price was last seen 0.2% higher, reaching at $192.38 on 05/16/2018. At recent session, the prices were hovering between $191.435 and $192.91. This company shares are 1.93% off its target price of $196.09 and the current market capitalization stands at $198.17B. The recent change has given its price a 7.29% lead over SMA 50 and -1.2% deficit over its 52-week high. The stock witnessed 7.87% gains, 11.51% gains and 28.52% gains for the 1-month, 3-month and 6-month period, respectively. To measure price-variation, we found MA‰Ûªs volatility during a week at 1.2% and during a month it has been found around 1.78%.Mastercard Incorporated (MA) exchanged hands at an unexpectedly low level of 2.11 million shares over the course of the day.

Larry Nassar survivor says MSU interim president attempted payoff,"A survivor of sexual abuse from Larry Nassar alleged on Friday that Michigan State interim president John Engler tried to pay her off to settle her civil lawsuit.When speaking at Michigan State's board of trustees meeting, 18-year-old Kaylee Lorincz said Engler offered her a check without her lawyer present.Lorincz said Engler's offer occurred on March 28 when she and her mother went to campus to sign up to speak at Friday's meeting, according to ESPN. Lorincz asked if she could meet Engler to introduce herself, and she was taken into a conference room with the interim president, his spokeswoman and an attorney.""Right now, if I wrote you a check for $250,000, would you take it?"" Lorincz said Engler asked her during the meeting.Gasps and outrage in the board room today when a Nassar survivor describes in great detail how she says MSU Interim President John Engler attempted to coerce her into settling her case against the university. @FOX2News Listen: pic.twitter.com/GiAbpR1S8f ‰ÛÓ Kellie Rowe (@kellierowe) April 13, 2018Lorincz explained to Engler that she did not want money but wanted to help the school create change. Engler said they could not work together until the civil suits were settled.She also said Engler told her that fellow gymnast Rachel Denhollander, the first woman to publicly accuse Nassar of sexual assault, gave him a number to write her a check. Lorincz said she asked Denhollander about the incident, and that Denhollander said she had never met with Engler or given him a dollar amount.MSU Pres Engler lied to a sister survivor and said I met with him and demanded money. Truth: He's refused to meet with me when political leaders asked him to, and I've never discussed money with anyone. He, and the Board who chose him, must go. ‰ÛÓ Rachael Denhollander (@R_Denhollander) April 13, 2018Lorincz is one of more than 200 women who have filed civil lawsuits claiming sexual assault abuse from Nassar, including Olympic gymnasts Aly Raisman and Simone Biles. The former USA Gymnastics and Michigan State doctor was sentenced to 40 to 175 years in prison after decades of sexual abuse.During her statement, Lorincz was interrupted and told she had run out of time. The crowd began to chant ""let her speak"" while police officers stood behind her trying to control the situation. Lorincz went on to finish her statement despite being told repeatedly she was out of time.""President Engler, you wanted to talk about money, and I wanted to talk about helping and healing,"" Lorincz said. ""You tried to make us feel like we were the problem and MSU was the victim because of the civil suits. This is how it works. When you protect and promote a sexual predator and foster a culture of lies and coverups, you are responsible.""This Nassar survivor was then interrupted and told her time was up. She said she wasn't finished, but was told repeatedly her time was up, as the crowd chanted ""let her speak.""

Avg. Price Target Review: Mastercard Incorporated (MA) to Hit $196.09 in short term period,"Mastercard Incorporated (MA) stock managed performance -1.53% over the last week and switched with performance of 6.36% throughout past one month period. The stock price exposed a move of 25.79% so far this year and uncovered flow of 63.80% in recent year. The shares price displayed 8.40% return during the recent quarter while it has presented performance of 28.36% over the past six months. The stock exhibited 64.78% change to a low over the previous 12 months and manifested move of -2.22% to a high over the same period.Moving toward the technical facts, its current distance from 20-Day Simple Moving Average is 3.04% and standing 5.87% away from 50-Day Simple Moving Average while traded 20.46% away from 200-Day Simple Moving Average.A moving average is the average price of a contract over the previous n-period closes. For example, a 20-period moving average is the average of the closing prices for the past 20 periods, including the current period. For intra-day data the current price is used in place of the closing price. The moving average is used to observe price changes. The effect of the moving average is to smooth the price movement so that the longer-term trend becomes less volatile and therefore more obvious.When the price rises above the moving average, it indicates that investors are becoming bullish on the commodity. When the prices falls below, it indicates a bearish commodity. As well, when a moving average crosses below a longer-term moving average, the study indicates a down turn in the market. When a short-term moving average crosses above a longer term moving average, this indicates an upswing in the market. The longer the period of the moving average, the smoother the price movement is. Longer moving averages are used to isolate long-term trends.Price Target Estimate:Analysts expected the average price target of $196.09 that is probable to reach in coming one year period. The price target of a stock is the price at which the stock is fairly valued with respect to its historical and projected earnings. Investors can maximize their rates of return by buying and selling stocks when they are trading below and above their price targets, respectively. Research analysts often publish stock price targets along with buy-sell recommendations. However, investors can and should determine their own price targets for entering and exiting stock positions.Investors could set buy and sell price points around target prices to maximize returns. The ideal time to buy a stock is usually when it is trading at a substantial discount to its target price. This discount could be the result of weak market conditions or overreaction to recent company setbacks. The ideal time to sell a stock is usually when it is trading higher than its target price range or during overheated markets.Mastercard Incorporated (MA) stock was active stock of Wall Street Market on Friday. MA moved -0.42% to 190.4. Mastercard Incorporated received interesting focus from Active Investors and it has been trading on front line as seeing to it recent volume. Considering that the stock recent volume of 4069111 shares, this represents a pretty noteworthy trading in volume size. This trading sentiment put the stock on Active spotlight. MA maintained activity of relative volume at 1.03.When analyzing volume, determine the strength or weakness of a move. As traders, we are more interested to take part in strong moves and don‰Ûªt join moves that show weakness ‰ÛÒ or we may even watch for an entry in the opposite direction of a weak move. These guidelines do not hold true in all situations, but they are a good general aid in trading decisions.Currently, the 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) reading is at 60.37. As you can see RSI calculation is fairly simple. The objective of using RSI is to help the trader identify over sold and overbought price areas. Overbought implies that the positive momentum in the stock is so high that it may not be sustainable for long and hence there could be a correction. Likewise, an oversold position indicates that the negative momentum is high leading to a possible reversal.When the RSI reading is between 30 and 0, the security is supposed to be oversold and ready for an upward correction. When the security reading is between 70 and 100, the security is supposed to be heavily bought and is ready for a downward correction. Institutional owners hold 77.90% stake while Insiders ownership held at 0.10% in the company.The Average True Range was recorded at 3.11. The volatility in the previous week has experienced by 1.07% and observed of 1.76% in the previous month. The stock price value Change from Open was at -0.64% with a Gap of 0.22%.

In addition, Inside Secure has expanded its participation this directory to now integrate Masterpass QR APIs into digital wallets so they can also accept QR payments.MerchantsMastercard Engage will now have a directory that provides merchants with access to 100 vendors who are self-certified for mobile point of sale solutions. The company also has plans to add vendors to a directory that will help merchants integrate Mastercard Send and MoneySend for instant payments.IoT Device ManufacturersManufacturers of IoT devices can work with Mastercard Engage partners to enable these devices with secure payments through the Mastercard Digital Enablement Service.

The Acquisition Presenting Mastercard With Numerous Opportunities,"In what is becoming old hat for investors, after Mastercard Inc (NYSE:MA) reported its first-quarter earnings, shares popped on the news even as the rest of the market trended downward. Not only did the payments network beat expectations when it reported its results earlier this month, it also raised its full-year guidance. The jump in share price, of course, was accompanied by another strong performance from the company's fundamentals.Mastercard's net revenue grew to $3.58 billion, a 31% increase year over year, and its earnings per share rose to $1.50, an even better 49% year-over-year increase. This strong top- and bottom-line growth was fueled by the company's 17% increase in switched transactions, the number of times a Mastercard account is used to facilitate a purchase, and a 14% increase in gross dollar volume, the total dollar amount of all transactions across Mastercard's network.Mastercard Metrics Q1 2018 Q1 2017 Change Net revenue $3.58 billion $2.73 billion 31% Diluted EPS $1.50 $1.01 49% Switched transactions 16.7 billion 14.7 billion 17% Gross payment volume $1.42 trillion $1.19 trillion 14% Other revenues segment $748 million $561 million 33%After reading through the company's conference call, the one thing that stood out the most is how many doors the acquisition of Vocalink seems to be opening for the company. While Mastercard has long used bolt-on acquisitions to opportunistically improve its offerings, Vocalink seems to be different. Not only is it immediately accretive to Mastercard's revenue growth, but it's also giving the company several longer-term growth opportunities. Let's take a closer look at what Vocalink gives Mastercard today and how it could give its parent company the upper hand over arch-rival Visa Inc (NYSE:V) in the years ahead.Mastercard's ""other"" growthVocaLink provides instant electronic bank account transfers, also known as Fast ACH, in key financial markets around the world including the U.K., Singapore, and Thailand. Most of Vocalink's revenue is accounted for in Mastercard's Other Revenues segment. This segment encompasses several services Mastercard offers its financial institution clients such as loyalty reward management, fraud protection, and data analytics. Last year, Mastercard management made it clear these services were differentiating it from its competition and helping it secure new deals with banks and merchants alike.While this classification of revenue has long been smaller relative to Mastercard's other revenue streams, it is growing rapidly. In Q1, Other Revenues grew to $748 million, a whopping 33% increase year over year! CFO Martina Hund-Mejean stated that without Vocalink's contributions to this segment, the annual growth rate would have been closer to 23%. While much of this contribution to growth is because the company is still lapping its initial acquisition, it's impossible not to notice the many opportunities Mastercard is exploiting thanks to Vocalink.Going globalIn the conference call, Mastercard management stated Vocalink was eyeing opportunities to expand its services internationally, especially as countries begin to update their clearing houses. Clearing houses are financial institutions that facilitate payments between banks within individual countries. The Automatic Clearing House (ACH) is the electronic payment system banks use within the U.S. to settle and clear payments. ACH payments are especially popular for processes such as direct deposit and bill payments because they are cheap. Unfortunately, they are also slow, which provides the opportunity for Vocalink's fast ACH capabilities.Countries looking to upgrade their antiquated systems to enable Fast ACH are turning to Vocalink, for single applications in some places but, also, to run the entire country's infrastructure. In the conference call, CEO Ajay Banga said:""The U.K. is where we not only participate in helping the infrastructure, we run it. In other countries like in the United States, it's our software that's powering the clearinghouse which is in the process of rolling out this instant ACH systems ... One where we are more than just software and also helping them actually manage their capabilities. We do that in Sweden. We do that in Singapore.""In these cases, Vocalink earns a licensing fee, Hund-Mejean pointed out, a basic fee for the payments made across the network. However, even more lucrative opportunities abound. In Thailand, for example, Vocalink is powering PromptPay, a mobile payment system that enables bank transfers using a citizen ID number. As of April, more than 40 million users had signed up for the service which has facilitated about $16 billion in payment volume over the past six months alone. In the United Kingdom, Vocalink is behind the Pay by Bank app, which allows consumers to make purchases using a direct debit straight from their bank account at the point-of-sale.Why B2B is the place 2BMastercard also believes Vocalink gives it a leg up on the competition by giving it the most comprehensive B2B (business-to-business) payment offerings. Both Mastercard and Visa have recently turned their attention to the B2B space, as a potentially huge, relatively untapped, area of growth. Hund-Mejean estimated the payment volume in the space could be as much as $124 trillion, of which ""only"" about $20 trillion or so is negotiated at the point-of-sale.In the conference call, after highlighting the many complications and inefficiencies in the B2B market as it exists today, Banga said Mastercard's cross-border capabilities combined with Vocalink's domestic ACH capabilities, gives the company a unique edge and skill set that allows him to approach potential clients with confidence, saying:That's where Mastercard Send and HomeSend on the one hand combined with Vocalink on the other is, to me, the killer app. So today I can go to the bank and go there and say I can meet your B2B needs. You want them through ACH and direct debit, talk to me. You want them through virtual cards, talk to me. You want them through commercial cards, talk to me. You want them through any aspect, I can help you. And I can help you Mr. Bank, and Mr. Medium and Small Merchant by making life easier for you, quicker for you, more efficient, easier to reconcile and streamline. That is our B2B strategy.Winners keep winningMastercard has returned an astounding 555% to investors over the past ten years, more than six times the S&P 500 index's return over that same period. Given its trailing twelve months EPS of $5.08 and based on my own calculations, the company currently trades at a steep P/E ratio of about 36 -- certainly not cheap! Given the huge run-up in price and the company's expensive valuation, some investors might be reluctant to add at these prices. Yet given the many tailwinds at its back and the opportunities its Vocalink acquisition is presenting to the company, Mastercard seems to be a case of a winner that keeps winning.","Not only is it immediately accretive to Mastercard's revenue growth, but it's also giving the company several longer-term growth opportunities.While much of this contribution to growth is because the company is still lapping its initial acquisition, it's impossible not to notice the many opportunities Mastercard is exploiting thanks to Vocalink.Going globalIn the conference call, Mastercard management stated Vocalink was eyeing opportunities to expand its services internationally, especially as countries begin to update their clearing houses.ACH payments are especially popular for processes such as direct deposit and bill payments because they are cheap.Yet given the many tailwinds at its back and the opportunities its Vocalink acquisition is presenting to the company, Mastercard seems to be a case of a winner that keeps winning.","['acquisition', 'numerous', 'ach', 'payments', 'billion', 'company', 'opportunities', 'presenting', 'vocalink', 'bank', 'growth', 'revenue', 'mastercard', 'payment']",,,"['Matthew Cochrane', 'As An Economic Crimes Detective', 'Matthew Focuses On Helping Others Becoming Victims Of Fraud', 'Scams.

"Mastercard, Express, Home Depot, Cisco Systems and Walmart highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day","For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL - May 14, 2018 - Zacks Equity Research highlights Mastercard MA as the Bull of the Day, Express EXPR as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis onThe Home Depot, Inc. HD , Cisco Systems, Inc. CSCO and Walmart Inc. WMT .Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:Bull of the Day :Headquartered in Purchase, NY, Mastercard is a leading global payment solutions company that provides an array of services in support of the credit, debit, mobile, web-based and contactless payments, and other related electronic payment programs to financial institutions and other entities.The company operates the world's fastest payment processing network, connecting consumers, financial institutions, merchants, governments and businesses in more than 210 countries.Better-than-expected ResultsThe company reported excellent results, beating on both the top and bottom lines and also upgraded its guidance.Adjusted earnings per share of $1.50 per share, were ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.26. Earnings were up 43% year over year (on a currency neutral basis). Revenues of $3.6 billion were up 27% year over year (on a currency neutral basis).Rising consumer spending and confidence drove the growth.""We are investing in areas such as safety and security and our digital solutions to drive long-term growth, with a focus on delivering simple and secure transactions across all channels,"" said the CEO.Rising EstimatesAnalysts have been raising the estimates for the company after strong results. Zacks Consensus Estimates for the current and next year have surged to $6.22 per share and $7.25 per share, from $5.94 and $6.96 respectively, before the results. Rising estimates sent the stock back to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Bear of the Day :It has been a very challenging environment for mall based retailers due to declining traffic, rising trend for online shopping and increasing competition from off-price fashion chains. Many of them have seen declining sales of late despite improving labor market.About the CompanyFounded in 1980 and is headquartered in Columbus, OH, Express is a retailer of specialty apparel and accessories for women and men. The company targets the 20 to 30 year old customer. They currently operate over 600 retail stores, located primarily in shopping malls, lifestyle centers, and street locations across the US, in Canada and in Puerto Rico.Their merchandise is also available at franchise stores in the Middle East and Latin America. Further, the Company also markets and sells its products through its e-commerce website.Weak Guidance Sends Stock LowerThe retailer reported its Q4 results on Mar 14. Adjusted earnings came in at $0.34 per share, slightly ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.32.Net sales increased 2% to $693.8 million from $678.8 million in the same quarter a year ago. They benefited from an extra week in the quarter.However, comparable sales fell 1%.E-commerce sales increased 20% and 17% on a comparable sales basis.However, guidance was weaker than street consensus. They expect FY 2018 comparable sales to be between -1% and 1% and earnings to be between $0.32 and $0.46.Shares fell after the report.Falling EstimatesAnalysts have slashed their estimates for the company after weak results and downbeat guidance. Zacks Consensus Estimates for the current and next fiscal year have plunged to $0.41 per share and $0.55 per share from $0.50 and $0.70 respectively, before the report.Declining estimates sent the stock to a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).The Bottom LineIn addition to disappointing consumer spending and mall traffic, the retail space is going through a shift toward online shopping. With tightening labor markets, ""wage pressure' has also started hurting retailers.Zacks Industry Rank of 156 out of 265 (Bottom 41%) for ""Retail-Apparel and Shoes"" also indicates more pain ahead.Additional content:Upcoming Earnings Reports to Watch: HD, CSCO & WMTStocks moved higher throughout the week, with solid earnings results and encouraging CPI figures proving stronger than concerns about tensions in the Middle East after the U.S. pulled out of the Iran nuclear deal.Still, investors probably need another batch of great reports if indexes truly want to break out of their recent range-bound trading, and Wall Street bulls will hope that comes from the retail and tech behemoths reporting next week.With that said, investors can always use the Zacks Earnings Calendar to plan out their schedules for earnings, dividend announcements, and other important financial releases. This handy tool is your perfect one-stop-shop to properly prepare for the market events that will have an impact on your own portfolio.And today, we've made that task even easier for you. Using the Earnings Calendar, we looked ahead to next week and selected the biggest reports to watch. Make sure to keep an eye on these companies as they prepare to report during the week of May 14.1. The Home Depot, Inc.Home improvement giant Home Depot is slated to release its latest quarterly financial results before the market opens on May 15. The stock tumbled about 16% from the all-time high it reached in January, but shares have rebounded-moving about 8% higher over the past month. Still, analyst sentiment has been mixed and HD currently has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Based on our latest Zacks Consensus Estimates, Home Depot is expected to post earnings of $2.07 per share and revenue of $25.23 billion. These results would mark year-over-year growth of 24.0% and 5.6%, respectively. However, this EPS estimate has trended downward recently, and our Most Accurate Estimate-which only looks at the most recent earnings estimates-sits two cents lower than the consensus.2. Cisco Systems, Inc.Information technology behemoth Cisco will announce its latest quarterly earnings figures after the market closes on May 16. The stock has surged about 9% in the past month and currently sports a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Our consensus estimates are calling for adjusted earnings of $0.65 per share and revenue of $12.42 billion.These earnings and revenue results would represent year-over-year growth of 8.3% and 4.0%, respectively. The consensus mark for earnings has trended upward over the duration of the quarter. For the full fiscal year, Cisco has witnessed three earnings estimate revisions in the past 30 days, with 100% agreement to the upside.3. Walmart Inc.Big box retail powerhouse Walmart is scheduled to release its latest quarterly earnings report before the market opens on May 17. Shares of the company have slipped nearly 4% in the past month, and sluggish analyst sentiment has earned the stock a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Still, investors will be excited to hear about key growth catalysts such as e-commerce sales.According to our latest Zacks Consensus Estimates, Walmart is expected to report earnings of $1.13 per share and revenue of $120.13 billion. These results would represent year-over-year growth of 13.0% and 2.2%, respectively. The consensus estimate for earnings has trended a bit higher recently, and the Most Accurate Estimate sits a penny higher.Want more market analysis from this author?

Mastercard scores win in debit card war with Visa,"Do you ever look very closely at the logo of the payment processor on your debt card?The chances are that, if you bank with one of the ""big five"" of Lloyds, Barclays, RBS/NatWest, HSBC or Santander - which is more than four in five Britons - you will see the Visa logo on it.The vast majority of the UK population currently use debit cards that are run on the Visa network.However, that is starting to change, as a new front in the war between Visa and its deadly rival, Mastercard, is opened.The first salvo from Mastercard was fired when, in June last year, it struck a seven-year deal with TSB, in which the bank said it would reissue debit cards to all of its current account customers, taking them into the Mastercard network.Image: Santander will begin migrating debit cards to Mastercard from 2019The deal, described at the time by Ajay Banga, Mastercard's chief executive, as a ""significant win"", made TSB Mastercard's largest debit card issuer in the UK.Today, Mastercard has scored another coup, with news that Santander will begin migrating debit cards held by its nine million-plus current account holders on to its network from the beginning of next year.With Virgin Money, Citibank, CYBG - owner of Clydesdale Bank and Yorkshire Bank - and Metro Bank also already issuing Mastercard debit cards, the addition of TSB and Santander mean Mastercard will have around a fifth of the market by this time next year.Mark Barnett, divisional president for Mastercard in the UK, said: ""We are excited about working with Santander, one of the world's most trusted and innovative banks, to bring new and customer-centric functionality to their debit card offering.""For us, this partnership is further proof that Mastercard's debit card solutions offer all the flexibility, security and convenience banks and their cardholders require in the digital age and, with this agreement, Mastercard gains real scale in the UK debit card market.""But what does a deal like this mean for customers?In theory, not a lot. It is very rare to come across a retailer or merchant that accepts cards from one issuer and not the other.In practice, it may well do in coming years.Both Visa and Mastercard are having to fight harder to convince investors they are not simply providers of commoditised services in the face of competition from newer entrants to the payment services market, such as PayPal, which are perceived as offering customers more ""value-added"".Mastercard, in particular, has sought to reduce its dependence on its core payments processing business, by expanding into other fields of payments in recent years, such as peer-to-peer payments.It is also investing more in offering security solutions to both banks and merchants, including the introduction of biometric authentication for cardholders, such as the ""Selfie Pay"" service launched in 2016.The company is also working to provide card issuers with better data analytics that helps them pick up on fraud more quickly, as well as helping them make fewer ""false declines"", which is the industry jargon for what happens when a card payment is wrongly blocked.And, in probably the most tangible example for customers, Mastercard is making loyalty offers based on its sponsorship of events such as the BRIT Awards and the UEFA Champions League.For Santander, there are also advantages. Banks save money when they can issue debit cards and credit cards on the same network as it enables them, in the words of a Santander spokesman, to ""streamline our internal processes to create less complexity and a smoother all round customer experience"".Do not expect Visa to take this lightly. The UK is its biggest market in Europe and it will seek to respond to Mastercard's incursion into the debit card market.The irony is that, in almost forcing customers to make a binary choice between them by striking exclusive deals with banks, Visa and Mastercard are turning the clock back.Until the mid-1970s, US laws appeared to block banks from joining both credit card issuers, obliging them to join either Visa or Mastercard. The same laws did not apply elsewhere in the world but, nonetheless, most payments markets tended to follow the US example.This meant Barclaycard became the provider of Visa in the UK, while NatWest, Midland Bank (now HSBC UK) and Lloyds joined forces in 1972 to launch the Access card, which operated on the Mastercard network.That system broke down when, in June 1987, Barclays introduced debit cards to Britain under the ""Connect"" brand which, like Barclaycard, carried the Visa logo.Shortly afterwards, Lloyds announced it would start issuing debit cards on the Visa network, making it the first UK bank to offer ""duality"". Midland began offering both Visa and Access credit cards shortly afterwards but, with debit cards, it, NatWest and Royal Bank of Scotland joined forces to create their own network called Switch (now part of Maestro, owned by Mastercard).More from Santander Plenty to smile about for Santander's bossOver time, all three drifted across from Maestro to Visa, a process that now appears to be in partial reverse with Mastercard's fightback.The market is once again becoming ""either/or"".","The vast majority of the UK population currently use debit cards that are run on the Visa network.Image: Santander will begin migrating debit cards to Mastercard from 2019The deal, described at the time by Ajay Banga, Mastercard's chief executive, as a ""significant win"", made TSB Mastercard's largest debit card issuer in the UK.""For us, this partnership is further proof that Mastercard's debit card solutions offer all the flexibility, security and convenience banks and their cardholders require in the digital age and, with this agreement, Mastercard gains real scale in the UK debit card market.""The UK is its biggest market in Europe and it will seek to respond to Mastercard's incursion into the debit card market.Shortly afterwards, Lloyds announced it would start issuing debit cards on the Visa network, making it the first UK bank to offer ""duality"".","['card', 'banks', 'visa', 'santander', 'war', 'debit', 'uk', 'win', 'cards', 'bank', 'mastercards', 'mastercard', 'scores']",,,"['Ian King', 'Business Presenter']",,https://news.sky.com/story/about-turn-as-mastercard-scores-win-in-debit-card-war-with-visa-11355944,,,,

When a stock‰Ûªs RSI falls under 30, it is considered to be oversold. For Mastercard Incorporated, specifically, the RSI metric has reached 60.37. Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) has gained 8.40% in value over the last three months, and 28.36% over the last six-month period. Over the last full year, the stock price has gained 63.80% .Let‰Ûªs move onto another metric: volatility. This term refers to the price range of a stock where a day trader makes his or her trades, which is essentially a measure of a specific stock‰Ûªs predictably price range per day. Higher levels of volatility indicate higher profits or losses. After recently verifying the number, Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) stock has a volatility measurement of 1.07% for the week, with 1.76% volatility as observed from the past 30 days. The public company has 1.05B shares outstanding currently, as well as a market cap of $199.76B.

This metric is a popular technical indicator first created by Larry Williams, its founder, and it enables traders to identify overbought and oversold stock territory. Seasoned stock traders will usually use the Williams %R metric in combination with other trend indicators to enable the locating of possible turning points in a specific stock‰Ûªs price path. Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA)‰Ûªs Williams Percent Range, or 14-day Williams %R, is sitting at 17.95 at the time of writing. Generally speaking, if the indicator rises above -20, the shares may be overbought. On the flip side, if the indicator goes below -80, it may mean that the stock has crossed over into oversold territory.Oftentimes, investors will keep tables on the most recent stock price support and resistance levels. When we say support, we mean the lower ‰ÛÏfloor‰Ûù level where a company‰Ûªs stock may bounce back after falling. If the stock‰Ûªs price can breach the first support level, then the general investor attention might transition to the second level. Resistance, on the other hand, is the opposite. While a certain stock increases in value, it might see a plunge as it reaches a specific level of resistance on the higher end.After a recent examination, this company‰Ûªs shares‰Ûª first resistance level is sitting at 191.53. Meanwhile, investors are looking out for the first support level, which is 189.83.","Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) lost -$0.8 before the end of the regular trading session on Friday, hitting $190.40.UBS Initiated shares of Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) to a Neutral rating in a report posted on Friday, May 18th, 2018.Bernstein, for example, Initiated Mastercard Incorporated to Outperform in a report that was made public on Wednesday, March 28th, 2018.In a report sent out on Thursday, February 1st, 2018, Sandler O‰ÛªNeill Upgrade the stock rating on Mastercard Incorporated from a Sell to a Hold.Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) has gained 8.40% in value over the last three months, and 28.36% over the last six-month period.","['shares', 'stock', 'level', 'williams', 'range', 'rating', 'incorporated', 'stocks', 'act', 'disguise', 'ma', 'blessing', 'mastercard', 'price']",,,[],5/21/18 0:00,http://www.fintelegraph.com/2018/05/21/mastercard-incorporated-ma-might-act-as-blessing-in-disguise/,,,,
Three Stocks That Carry Skyscraping Pretax Margins,"When a company posts high pretax margins year after year, the situation points to two realities.XThe first reality is that the company is doing something right. The second is that the company might be operating in a space where high profit margins are the rule, not the exception.Take a look at three stocks that have appeared recently in the Big Cap 20 with the best pretax margins.The three are Mastercard (MA), E-Trade (ETFC) and Charles Schwab (SCHW).See a trend? Yes, the money businesses are places where high margins are commonplace.In that situation, how should an investor respond? Should the investor buy shares and then sit back and watch the stock price rise?If only it were that simple.Ask Two QuestionsWhen weighing stocks with high pretax margins, the investor should ask two questions.How do those margins look vs. companies in the same industry group? (Maybe in that context they are not so high after all.)And how do the margins compare to the company's history? (In some cases, margins may be declining.)Mastercard posted a pretax margin of 53.6% in 2017.In the eight previous years from 2009 to 2016, Mastercard's average pretax margin was 51.9%.The highest was 55.1% in 2013. The lowest was 44.1% in 2009.Within the credit payment processor group, only one stock in 2017 had a higher pretax margin than Mastercard ‰ÛÓ Visa (V), which had a 64.7% pretax margin last year.E-Trade Financial pegged a 45.9% pretax margin in 2017. In three of the previous eight years, the company lost money. The average pretax margin in the remaining five years was 25.7%.Does that sound like a problem? It isn't. Pretax margin stepped up in each of the past five years ‰ÛÓ 17.2% in 2013 and then 25.3%, 36.6%, 41.4% and 45.9%.Within the brokerage group, two stocks had a higher pretax margin than E-Trade ‰ÛÓ Interactive Brokers (IBKR) (pretax margin 54.4% in 2017) and MarketAxess (MKTX) (50.9% in 2017).Schwab's StreakCharles Schwab achieved a pretax margin of 42.4%. This represented the fifth consecutive year of increasing pretax margins.The average pretax margin over the previous eight years was 31.8%.In the brokerage group, the three aforementioned brokerages did better than Schwab on pretax margin ‰ÛÓ Interactive Brokers, MarketAxess and E-Trade.Consider All The CriteriaAlthough profit margins are important, the full range of CAN SLIM criteria should be considered before buying a stock.In some cases, a strong stock may have thin margins. Amazon.com (AMZN) had a pretax margin of 2.1% in 2017. Netflix (NFLX) delivered a pretax margin of 4.2% last year. Yet, both companies had strong revenue growth in 2017.RELATED:Oil Driller Offers High Dividend YieldP/E Ratio?

Mastercard blames cryptocurrencies for slight drop in first-quarter growth,"Mastercard blames cryptocurrencies for slight drop in first-quarter growth 5:50 PM ET Thu, 3 May 2018 | 00:58A drop in customers buying cryptocurrencies with credit cards slightly dampened Mastercard's quarterly growth, the company said on an earnings call this week.While cross-border volumes grew by 19 percent, that number dropped by 2 percentage points from the fourth quarter, in part because fewer people bought digital currencies like bitcoin with their credit cards.""This is due to the recent drop-off in crypto wallet funding,"" Mastercard chief financial officer Martina Hund-Mejean said on the earnings call Wednesday. ""We expect cross-border growth to moderate somewhat.""Customers can use Mastercard to buy in and out of cryptocurrencies, and store them into what's known as ""crypto wallet.""

Domestic Remittances Offered by Western Union Though Mastercard Send,"Although the growth of debit card payments may be slipping, the use of a debit card number as a proxy for a bank account to receive funds is expanding. Street Insider and other news outlets announced the launch of a service offered by Western Union to push funds to a debit card using Mastercard Send. Note that funds can be sent to any card, not just those branded Mastercard.Today Mastercard (NYSE: MA) and The Western Union Company (NYSE: WU) announced they are working together to integrate Mastercard Send into the Western Union Money Transferå¨ service, allowing Western Union to deliver funds to virtually all U.S. debit cards. The alliance opens a new channel for U.S. consumers to quickly and conveniently send money via Western Union to the debit cards people use every day, including non-Mastercard cards. Western Union is the money transfer industry‰Ûªs first to offer the debit card-enabled service via the Mastercard Send platform in the United States. The new Western Union service, expected to be available in early 2018, will initially offer digital funds transfers within the U.S. via westernunion.com and the WU mobile app, enabling senders to use their U.S. debit, credit and bank accounts to fund a payment. Customers simply need to know the recipient‰Ûªs 16-digit debit card number to complete the transfer.Using cards through one of the network push payment network is considered a better consumer experience since only the card number needs to be known, rather than an R/T and checking account number. The push payment networks also have (or will have) the capability to deliver transactions globally, but I wouldn‰Ûªt look for that service to be offered by a money transfer operator unless they can also control the compliance and foreign exchange aspects.Overview by Sarah Grotta, Director, Debit Advisory Service at Mercator Advisory GroupRead the full story here","Street Insider and other news outlets announced the launch of a service offered by Western Union to push funds to a debit card using Mastercard Send.Today Mastercard (NYSE: MA) and The Western Union Company (NYSE: WU) announced they are working together to integrate Mastercard Send into the Western Union Money Transferå¨ service, allowing Western Union to deliver funds to virtually all U.S. debit cards.The alliance opens a new channel for U.S. consumers to quickly and conveniently send money via Western Union to the debit cards people use every day, including non-Mastercard cards.Western Union is the money transfer industry‰Ûªs first to offer the debit card-enabled service via the Mastercard Send platform in the United States.Customers simply need to know the recipient‰Ûªs 16-digit debit card number to complete the transfer.","['card', 'funds', 'debit', 'number', 'offered', 'union', 'remittances', 'send', 'western', 'money', 'mastercard', 'service', 'domestic']",,,[],2017-10-25 12:22:50-04:00,http://paymentsjournal.com/domestic-remittances-offered-western-union-though-mastercard-send/,,,,
"McDonald's, Apple, Pfizer, MasterCard and Activision-Blizzard are part of Zacks Earnings Preview","For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL - April 30, 2018 - Zacks.com releases the list of companies likely to issue earnings surprises. This week's list includes McDonald's MCD , Apple AAPL , Pfizer PFE , MasterCard MA and Activision-Blizzard ATVI .To see more earnings analysis, visit https://at.zacks.com/?id=3207 .Every day, Zacks.com makes their Bull Stock of the Day available, free of charge. To see it, click here .Q1 Earnings Season: Good, but Not GreatThe picture emerging from the Q1 earnings season, which has now crossed the halfway mark, is one of all-around strength, with Q1 earnings and revenue growth on track to reach its highest level in 7 years.This is a good showing, but two aspects of this earnings season hold us back from calling it a great performance. First, estimates for the current period have failed thus far to go up, as had been the case ahead of the start of the Q1 earnings season. Second, positive surprises are tracking above historical periods, but they remain below what we had seen in the preceding earnings season, particularly on the revenue front.Many of you will justifiably look at these issues as nothing more than nit-picking and we acknowledge the all-strength and growth momentum as well. But we can't ignore the fact that Q1 performance lags what we saw in the preceding earnings season in some respects, particularly how the 2018 Q2 revisions trend is shaping up.A big part of the positive revisions we saw ahead of the start of the Q1 earnings season reflected the direct impact of the tax law changes, which was obviously a one-off development. Had all positive revisions been a result of tax law changes, we would have seen only EPS estimates go up, with no changes to revenue estimates. But that wasn't the case, as revenue estimates had gone up as well, which raised our hopes that the aggregate revisions trend had finally turned positive after many years being in the other direction.We have a busy reporting docket this week, with more than 900 companies reporting Q1 results, including 142 S&P 500 members, and the revisions trend could turn around. But if we haven't seen evidence of positive revisions thus far, the odds are that we wouldn't see them in the coming days either.McDonald's and Apple are the more notable of the 142 index members coming out with results this week. Other major companies this include Pfizer on Tuesday, May 1st, MasterCard on Wednesday May 2nd and Activision-Blizzard on Thursday May 3rd.McDonald's is the notable of the 12 S&P 500 members reporting Q1 results on Monday, April 30th. The fast-good giant is expected to earn $1.67 per share on $4.93 billion in revenues, up +13.6% and down -13.8% from the year-earlier period, respectively. The revisions trend has been stable, though estimates have modestly come down over the last two months. The stock has struggled since late January, down -7.2% in the year-to-date period, lagging the S&P 500 index's almost flat showing in the same period.Apple will be in the spotlight on a very busy reporting day on Tuesday, May 1st. The iPhone maker is expected to earn $2.69 per share on $61.1 billion in revenues, up +28.1% and +15.5% from the year-earlier period, respectively. The revisions trend has been negative, with the current $2.69 EPS estimate down from $2.71 a month back and $2.84 three months back. As always, the focus will be on iPhone sales, which are expected to have reached 52.94 million in Q1, up from 50.76 million units in the year-earlier quarter. The company came up short of iPhone shipments expectations in the December quarter when it sold 77.3 million versus expectations of 79.8 million. The stock has lagged the Tech sector in the year-to-date and trailing 12-month period.Q1 Earnings Season Scorecard ( as of Friday, April 27th )Total earnings for the 267 S&P 500 members that have reported results already are up +25.1% from the same period last year on +10% higher revenues, with 76.8% beating EPS estimates and 73.8% beating revenue estimates. The proportion of companies beating both EPS and revenue estimates is 61.4%.About ZacksZacks.com is a property of Zacks Investment Research, Inc., which was formed in 1978.

Do Analysts Think You Should Buy ‰ÛÒ Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE: MA) ‰ÛÒ Stocks Pen,"U.S. stocks closed lower Tuesday, with major indexes turning decisively negative in afternoon trading and ending near their lows of the day as uncertainty over trade policy and other geopolitical issues remained high.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 178.88 points, or 0.72%, to 24,834.41. The S&P 500 lost 8.57 points, or 0.31%, to 2,724.44. Among the day‰Ûªs biggest decliners were industrial stocks, a sector that is heavily correlated with trade concerns.

Asked if he was happy with how U.S.-China trade talks were going, President Donald Trump told reporters, ‰ÛÏNot really,‰Ûù and said negotiations ‰ÛÏhave a long way to go.‰ÛùOptimism over trade had spurred a stock rally in Monday‰Ûªs session, after Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said that the Trump administration would ‰ÛÏput the trade war on hold‰Ûù while working out details of a deal between the countries. Trump‰Ûªs comments seemed to offset Mnuchin‰Ûªs view.Other geopolitical tensions also continued to hover in the background, with uncertainty over a historic meeting between Trump and North Korea‰Ûªs dictator Kim Jong Un. Vice President Mike Pence warned in an interview late Monday that North Korea cannot ‰ÛÏplay‰Ûù Trump where nuclear disarmament is concerned. On Tuesday, Trump said a planned summit with Un may happen later than presently planned.Meanwhile, laying out new demands for Iran on Monday, the White House said any new nuclear deal with the U.S. would require Iran to stop enriching uranium and to pull its support for militant groups in the Middle East.

The ratio between current volume and 3-month average value, also known as Relative volume was observed at 0.67, validating the stock‰Ûªs In Play state.Stock Technical‰Ûªs & Performances to Explore:Based on a recent bid, this stock (MA) was trading at a distance of -1.59% from 52-week high and 62.97% away from its 52-week low price. We observed -0.20% rate of return for a stock for the last 5-trading days, which was maintained for the month at 9.23%. Likewise, the performance for the quarter was recorded as 11.20% and for the year was 61.03%. The comparison of these above mentioned historical values gives an idea to investor whether the stock is ready to shift trend (up to down or down to up) or how the stock has recovered the losses or shed gains during its historical phase. For example, if stock‰Ûªs weekly and monthly performances are positive as compared to year and YTD performance percentage also seems to decrease in comparison to the previous year performance, then one can say that the stock is bouncing back and may able to gain more and more in near future and vice versa. Although stock‰Ûªs historical performances are key to consider, don‰Ûªt invest (or not invest) based solely on it. It‰Ûªs just one measure of value. As a serious shareholder, you need to look at plentiful factors that can assist you determine whether any given stock is a good investment.Simple Moving Averages (SMAs) in Focus:Moving averages is one of the key indicator and the most powerful tool used by traders. A simple moving average is easy to calculate, which allows it to be employed fairly quickly and easily. A textbook definition of a moving average is an average price for a security using a specified time period. The simplest form of a moving average, appropriately known as a simple moving average (SMA), is calculated by taking the arithmetic mean of a given set of values. For example, to calculate a basic 10-day moving average you would add up the closing prices from the past 10 days and then divide the result by 10. If a trader wishes to see a 50-day average instead, the same type of calculation would be made, but it would include the prices over the past 50 days and the same process goes on for 200 days.Do SMAs Signal a Trend Reversal?Based on a recent bid, this stock (MA) was trading at a distance of 2.89% from 20 days simple moving average, and its distance from 50 days simple moving average is 6.32% while it has a distance of 20.77% from the 200 days simple moving average. A moving average‰Ûªs greatest strength is its ability to assist a trader identifies a current trend or spots a possible trend reversal. Moving averages can also identify a level of support or resistance for the security, or act as a simple entry or exit signal.Stock‰Ûªs Volatility Analysis:Volatility is the degree of variation of a trading price series over time as measured by the standard deviation of logarithmic returns. It generally deals with the amount of uncertainty or risk about the size of changes in a security‰Ûªs value. It can either be calculated by means of the standard deviation or variance between returns from that same security or market index. The Rule of thumb is higher the volatility, the riskier the security. A higher volatility means that a security‰Ûªs value can potentially be spread out over a larger range of values. This means that the price of the security can change dramatically over a short time period in either direction. A lower volatility means that a security‰Ûªs value does not fluctuate dramatically, but changes in value at a steady pace over a period of time.What about MA Stock‰Ûªs Volatility?According to finviz data, MA stock‰Ûªs volatility for the week is measured at 1.01%, while for the month it is maintained at 1.69%.An Eye on Beta Factor:One gauge of the relative volatility of a specific stock to the market is its beta. A beta approximates the overall volatility of a security‰Ûªs returns against the returns of a relevant benchmark (usually the S&P 500 is used). Presently, Beta factor for MA stock stands at 1.18. A beta of 1 indicates that the security‰Ûªs price moves with the market. A beta of less than 1 means that the security is theoretically less volatile than the market. A beta of greater than 1 indicates that the security‰Ûªs price is theoretically more volatile than the market. For example, if a stock‰Ûªs beta is 1.2, it‰Ûªs theoretically 20% more volatile than the market. Conversely, if an ETF‰Ûªs beta is 0.65, it is theoretically 35% less volatile than the market. Therefore, the fund‰Ûªs excess return is predictable to underperform the benchmark by 35% in up markets and outperform by 35% during down markets.What Do Analysts‰Ûª Recommend?Analysts mean recommendation for the stock is 1.70, (where 1 is Strong Buy and 5 is Strong Sell).Disclaimer: Any news, report, research and analysis published on Stockspen.com are only for information purposes.

"Igor Stepanov, Regional Director of Mastercard in Georgia and Central Asia: åÇOver 70% of Georgia‰Ûªs residents prefer to pay with a smartphoneåÈ","The FINANCIAL -- As the digitalization process of life faces significant changes, companies, as well as customers have been forced to adapt. Mastercard has made a number of important changes over the past few years. Mastercard had to overcome significant challenges to develop effective digital tools that meet the differing needs of the countries it operates in. Also, by modernizing, particularly through digital services, banks currently have an opportunity to differentiate themselves in a crowded market.During the last decade, the development of smartphones has had a profound impact on the way businesses operate. With the percentage of the global population using smartphones increasing every year, businesses are now expected to provide a fully integrated digital platform that can provide different services. Today digital services are no longer something new and strange: they are the bare minimum that customers expect.Q. How would you estimate cashless payments development in the country? Has Georgia made a progress in e-economy development?A. Georgia is very innovative country, and it‰Ûªs moving towards a world without cash at a steady pace. Over the last 3-4 years both, the number and volume of POS transactions, has grown considerably. According to the National Bank of Georgia, non-cash payments increased by 20 per cent over a year. As for the contactless payments penetration, Georgia today is among the leaders in the region, almost every second transaction here made with a payment card is contactless. Online commerce is developing rapidly, the number of online payments has grown by 41 per cent in 2017. All these wins evidence a massive progress in cashless economy development in Georgia.Q. Tell us about the key findings of a recent survey conducted by Mastercard, what is special about payment behavior and demand of consumers in Georgia today?A. ‰ÛÏDigitalization of Life‰Ûù survey once again showed how Georgia is open to innovative payment solutions, supporting global digital trends and even outstripping European preferences for innovations in some areas. For instance, 44 per cent of research participants consider fingerprint recognition the most preferred method of identity check, whereas only about 38 per cent of Europeans prefer this method. Contactless card has already become a symbol of speed and comfort of payments in the country, where 48 per cent of respondents use it for payments. Today, we see the emergence of a new trend, smartphone payments. We at Mastercard do a lot together with our partner banks to develop a ""digital"" lifestyle: in particular, Georgian cardholders got new opportunities for digital payments with the launch of the first NFC-wallets for smartphone payments in the country.Q. And what about e-shopping? You were mentioning 41 per cent growth of online payments, but is it already a trend?A. According to our study, 38 per cent of Georgia residents are using digital services for online purchases already. Speed and time savings turned out to be the main argument for this ‰ÛÒ the most of respondents highlighted those benefits. And this is e-commerce that our respondents have referred to top-3 areas where they would like to use payment cards. Therefore, I believe e-commerce is a promising trend in the country and one of top priorities for Mastercard.Q. What about fraud in Georgia, particularly in online?A. Georgia has relatively low level of those; this is mainly due to popularity of contactless technology, which is now one of the most safe and secure. Data cannot be stolen, card cannot be copied. As for online payments, security is again ensured by Mastercard high level global standards, Mastercard SecureCode is a program designed to protect consumer against unauthorized use of card, as well as provide online merchants with the added security of having issuing banks authenticate cardholders and qualify online transactions for protection against ""cardholder unauthorized"" or ""cardholder not recognized"" chargebacks. Today globally Mastercard establishes biometrics as the new normal for safer online shopping, this shift is a part of Mastercard‰Ûªs new action plan to help banks, retailers and partners, to prevent fraud and improve the consumer experience in the new digital environment. It also meets new requirements around customer authentication via 3D Secure protocol.Q. Since internet banking and online payments (via bank) is developing very quickly - how significantly affects it card payments?A. Boundaries between physical and digital purchase and payment experience are dissolving worldwide. A bank card, no matter in a physical or electronic wallet, so far remains the most popular, secure and convenient payment tool. The development of online payments and Internet banking simply creates an extra dimension for paying with the card.Q. Don‰Ûªt you think that digital wallets may replace card payments in the near future? If yes, how may cards be transformed in the future?A. User experience is changing indeed; it‰Ûªs becoming more and more digitalized and mobile. Studies carried out by Mastercard show that a quarter of Europeans (24%) would now like to pay using wearable devices (fitness-bracelets, smart watches etc.). Smartphone becomes number one gadget for payments globally. According to the Mastercard ‰Û÷Impact of Innovation‰Ûª study, mobile payments have the highest potential across all countries ‰ÛÒ nearly 50 per cent of Europeans put mobile phone on the first place among the preferable payment devices. And in Georgia this index is even higher ‰ÛÒ 74 per cent prefer this device as a payment tool. NFC payments are booming globally having a high potential for further increase, still I expect observing a variety of options for payments for consumer, both plastic and digital tools, in the near future, as this would provide the consumer with an opportunity to make a choice based on the preferences and life style.Q. Tell us more about NFC-wallets in Georgia, which banks now offer them to consumers?A. Recently, three NFC wallets were launched, by Bank of Georgia, TBC Bank and VTB Bank, in partnership with Mastercard. It was particularly enabled by our tokenization platform, MDES (Mastercard Digital Enablement Service), which allows to turn connected devices into payment ones. Due to tokenization, the original payment credentials (16-digit account number) is replaced with a unique ‰ÛÏdigital account number‰Ûù (token) which may be used to initiate payment activity for wallet transactions. In 2017 the amount of payments via MDES has grown by 100 times globally, NFC payments is now a global trend, and we a very happy to drive it with our partners here.Q. What about competitors, what‰Ûªs your further strategy and special offer to the consumer?A. Our key competitor is cash, and we are committed to creating future without cash in a safer, more open and comfortable world. We are constantly working on the technological side of payments introducing new ways of purchases, in online, via gadgets, etc., enabling the most demanded and secure authentication methods, including fingerprint, face recognition. We are integrating payments everywhere you need them ‰ÛÒ in shops, public transport, major events, online ecosystem. With all that today Mastercard card is more than just a payment tool. This is a key to special offers and benefits, and even more ‰ÛÒ to the priceless emotions and experiences. Special rewards and opportunities for travelers, shoppers, football fans, cinema-lovers, digital adopters, these are only few directions to mention, that we are empowering together with our partners in Georgia.","Online commerce is developing rapidly, the number of online payments has grown by 41 per cent in 2017.Since internet banking and online payments (via bank) is developing very quickly - how significantly affects it card payments?Recently, three NFC wallets were launched, by Bank of Georgia, TBC Bank and VTB Bank, in partnership with Mastercard.It was particularly enabled by our tokenization platform, MDES (Mastercard Digital Enablement Service), which allows to turn connected devices into payment ones.With all that today Mastercard card is more than just a payment tool.","['card', 'cent', 'stepanov', 'online', 'digital', 'pay', 'payments', 'smartphone', 'georgias', 'prefer', 'number', 'bank', 'igor', 'georgia', 'regional', 'mastercard', 'residents', 'payment']",,,[],2018-04-30 08:07:37+00:00,https://www.finchannel.com/business/banksandservices/166-georgian-banks/73284-igor-stepanov-regional-director-of-mastercard-in-georgia-and-central-asia-over-70-of-georgia-s-residents-prefer-to-pay-with-a-smartphone,,,,
"Plastic-Versus-Cash Battle Heats Up After Visa, Mastercard Deals","The dollar bill, that long-time rival of credit-card giants, is under attack once again.After years of fighting to get their cards accepted in stores, Visa Inc. and Mastercard Inc. are stepping up efforts to get merchants and consumers to move to a cashless world.The idea is simple and potentially very profitable: Get people to use their credit cards rather than cash for more purchases -- and, eventually, all transactions. In that future, card networks and other electronic payment systems would essentially get a slice of every transaction.Visa and Mastercard already have made big inroads in expanding credit-card usage. They handled $4.3 trillion in payments in the U.S. last year, more than double from a decade ago. Still, the amount of currency in circulation also has doubled in that period, and cash remains the most widely used payment instrument in the U.S.Last week, Visa upped the ante in its push to put cash out of business. The network said that it will give 50 restaurants that agree to ditch cash for good a $10,000 reward to spend on marketing and point-of-sale technology.‰ÛÏThe U.S. still has an enormous amount of headroom to grow in terms of displacing more cash,‰Ûù said Jack Forestell, head of global merchant solutions at Visa. ‰ÛÏIt‰Ûªs a much more significant opportunity for us than trying to steal share from a competitor.‰ÛùRead more: Do we need cash?Such incentives are aimed at chipping away at merchants‰Ûª skepticism toward taking cards only. Some fear they will alienate customers who prefer to use cash, according to Christophe Vergne, who leads the payments practice at Capgemini Global Financial Services. And many store owners want to avoid the fees that come with accepting cards, which range from about 22 cents for a debit-card purchase to 2 percent of the total bill for a credit-card purchase.‰Û÷Accept Everything‰Ûª‰ÛÏMerchants in general are unwilling to push customers to do one thing or another -- merchants want to accept everything,‰Ûù said Chris Donat, an analyst at Sandler O‰ÛªNeill who covers Visa and Mastercard.But Vergne thinks more merchants are learning that handling cash isn‰Ûªt free.‰ÛÏThey have to take the cash to the bank, or they have to pay cash transporters to come and collect the cash -- and they have to pay employees to count the money at the end of the day,‰Ûù he said.The U.S. is far from the leader in non-cash payments. Cards are the only form of accepted payment at many places across Sweden, the most cashless society on the planet. And recently, the world‰Ûªs largest payment networks saw a surge in transactions and cardholders after the Indian government‰Ûªs decision to remove high-denomination bills from circulation last year. India retreated somewhat from the policy after a shortage of cash choked parts of the economy.War on CashMastercard Chief Executive Officer Ajay Banga has been one of the most ardent supporters of ditching paper currency in the U.S. The 57-year-old first declared his war on cash in 2010, shortly after taking the helm at the company. More recently, his network has been signing deals with third-party payment providers to help propel the conversion from cash to card in certain sectors including education and rent.‰ÛÏI view cash as the real competitor for the company,‰Ûù Banga said during the company‰Ûªs annual shareholder meeting last month.In the U.S., cash is used for more than 60 percent of purchases under $10, according to the Federal Reserve.Cash isn‰Ûªt the only foe. American Express Co. has begun to target government and health care, sectors that typically rely on check payments, said Ed Jay, executive vice president of merchant services at AmEx. The network has also targeted small businesses, adding over a million merchant locations in 2016, including 7,000 dry cleaners and 58,000 salons. It has said it will have as many U.S. merchants as Visa and Mastercard by the end of next year, or more than 10 million locations.Read more: Buy eggs, watch your underwear spin with Mastercard innovations‰ÛÏThe progress that‰Ûªs been made is certainly remarkable,‰Ûù said Linda Kirkpatrick, executive vice president of U.S. merchants and acceptance at Mastercard. ‰ÛÏI don‰Ûªt have to pay for parking with cash. I don‰Ûªt have to pay for my train ticket with cash.

Can Mastercard Stock Get a Charge Out of Earnings?,"Can Mastercard Stock Get a Charge Out of Earnings?We analyzed Mastercard Inc. (MA) a month ago, and I wrote that, ""The charts and indicators are suggesting that MA can weaken in the next month or two. We could retest the $160 area or the lows of February. With support beginning at $155, a significant decline is probably not in the cards right now.""MA weakened into early April and has firmed back to $180 twice but our indicators remain weak. Let's check and see if there is a reason to shift gears ahead of earnings Wednesday.In this daily bar chart of MA, below, we can see price and volume and some indicators. Prices have been crossing above and below the still rising 50-day moving average line the past five weeks. MA is still above the rising 200-day line so the longer-term trend is up.Now look at the volume histogram below the price chart -- volume has been slowing since early February. If volume was building up the past three months ahead of earning I would be more positive. The daily On-Balance-Volume (OBV) line has been rolling over slightly the past three months suggesting that sellers of MA have been slowly becoming more aggressive. In the lower panel you can see that price momentum has been growing weaker since mid-January.In this weekly bar chart of MA, below, the indicators are mostly bullish. Prices are above the rising 40-week moving average line. The weekly OBV line is steady but the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) oscillator has already turned down with a take profits sell signal.In this Point and Figure chart of MA, below, we can see an upside price target of $193. But a decline to $178 or $168 could weaken the picture should it develop.Bottom line: MA has been largely stuck in a sideways trend the past two to three months. Volume has diminished and momentum has weakened. These are not ""run out and sell"" signals but I would be cautious near-term.","Can Mastercard Stock Get a Charge Out of Earnings?In this daily bar chart of MA, below, we can see price and volume and some indicators.Prices have been crossing above and below the still rising 50-day moving average line the past five weeks.Now look at the volume histogram below the price chart -- volume has been slowing since early February.Bottom line: MA has been largely stuck in a sideways trend the past two to three months.","['rising', 'stock', 'indicators', 'moving', 'line', 'months', 'ma', 'chart', 'past', 'volume', 'mastercard', 'earnings', 'charge', 'price']",,,[],,https://realmoney.thestreet.com/articles/05/01/2018/can-mastercard-stock-get-charge-out-earnings,,,,

Mastercard May Support Cryptocurrencies,"In a conversation with the Financial Times, it appears that Mastercard has warmed up to the idea of cryptocurrencies, thanks to a series of statements made by Ari Sakar, Mastercard‰Ûªs co-president for Asia-Pacific. Sakar said that Mastercard is exploring cryptocurrency options backed by governments.If governments look to create national digital currency we‰Ûªd be very happy to look at those in a more favourable way. So long as it‰Ûªs backed by a regulator and it is not anonymous, and that it meets all the regulatory requirements. I think that would be of greater interest for us to explore.The above statements by Sakar contrast sharply with Ajay Bangar‰Ûªs remarks on virtual currencies, who is the CEO of Mastercard. In a conversation with the Economic Times in October last year, Bangar said that non-government mandated currencies were ‰ÛÏjunk.‰ÛùIf the government creates digital currency, we will find a way to be in the game. We will provide rails for moving currency from customer to merchant. The government mandated digital currencies are interesting. Non-government mandated currency is junk.Adding to the sting against cryptocurrency traders, VISA and Mastercard classified cryptocurrency purchases as ‰ÛÏcash advance.‰Ûù This means that customers now pay 5% more for virtual currencies, on top of the fees charged by the exchanges.Mastercard Labs: the Future of Commerce?In spite of Mastercard‰Ûªs ambivalent stance towards cryptocurrencies, the giant has launched its own blockchain initiatives with Mastercard Labs, which includes 3 blockchain APIs and patents for blockchain-based settlements.According to the patent submissions, Steven Charles Davis and Ashish Raghavendra Tetali designed software that uses blockchain-based settlements. These patents describe applications that perform validation controls for transactions.These patents are apparently just the beginning of Mastercard‰Ûªs initatives into the space of the blockchain and its payment processing architecture.Mastercard made the following statement regarding its launch of blockchain-related patents:Accordingly, the use of traditional payment networks and payment systems technologies in combination with blockchain currencies may provide consumers and merchants the benefits of the decentralized blockchain while still maintaining security of account information and provide a strong defense against fraud and theft.Mastercard intends to win the technological race with its new blockchain APIs and other patents. It‰Ûªs also possible that the blockchain will be used in the company‰Ûªs internal infrastructure too, giving the rate of steady adoption in financial markets. This adoption is apparent in an interview with Ann Cairns, president of international markets at markets, she said:‰ÛÏWe are already building use cases in our laboratories to see how to include it together with our core systems.‰ÛùCover Photo by Michael on UnsplashCommitment to Transparency: The author of this article is invested and/or has an interest in one or more assets discussed in this post.

Can Mastercard Master the Competition?,"Mastercard Inc. ( MA ) is one of the largest financial services companies on the planet. We all know someone who has a Mastercard credit or debit card - probably many someones. As the world moves ever further toward a cashless society, Mastercard, a company that has been at the forefront of non-cash payment innovation for many years, is worth another look.As 2017 winds down, what can we say about Mastercard's stock performance this year? Not surprisingly in this market, it has done pretty well, enjoying a strongly entrenched position in the American financial system and boasting solid financials.And there is still a lot of market to be claimed: Cash is still used for 80% of transactions around the world. That number is dropping every year as more and more people and businesses abandon paper for plastic - or for ones and zeroes. Mastercard is working to seize a big piece of that pie, while at the same time both retaining its current massive user base and expand from its core business.Will Mastercard's efforts be enough to see it triumph in the years ahead? Let's take a look at the company's recent performance, as well as its plans for the future, to see if we can find out.An impressive growth machineFinancial performance remains a highlight for Mastercard. In the third quarter, the company turned in an impressive performance, with net income of $1.43 billion on $3.4 billion in revenue, up from income of $1.18 billion on $2.8 billion in revenue the previous quarter. That spike in growth is largely attributable to a surge in purchase volume, which was up 11% for the quarter. Double-digit growth is visible in every region in which the company operates, especially in the Asian market. MasterCard Send, the company's push payments program, has also shown promising signs in its early outings.In an increasingly card payments-dominated world, the MasterCard brand benefits. Every time someone swipes one of the 2.4 billion MasterCard and Maestro cards somewhere in the world, Mastercard gets its transaction fee. Those continue to add up and drive very significant value. In the third quarter, the company posted a 21% profit. Earnings were remarkably robust, posting a 9% positive surprise over consensus estimate.With solid earnings and continuing market growth, Mastercard looks poised to continue its streak of financial success into 2018. Clearly the Street seems to think the future is mighty bright. Many analysts and commentators have long sung the praises of Mastercard. Motley Fool's Stock Advisor has been particularly effusive of late and the investment banks and research firms have likewise been generally positive. Among their number, the consensus recommendation is strong buy (based on 24 analyst recommendations), a consensus broken by just a few, lukewarm dissenters who merely recommend the company as a buy (three analysts) or hold (one lonely, middle-of-the-road thinker).New offerings bring opportunity and riskIt can be argued the mobile payment space is getting crowded. So it is little surprise that Mastercard is seeking to differentiate itself in a number of ways from major competitors such as Visa ( V ) and American Express ( AXP ).Mastercard's choice to expand its offerings beyond its core payments business and into consulting and advisory practice, which has so far contributed significantly to revenue growth, is the most significant example of the company seeking to set itself apart from the pack. It has executed the launch of these new lines successfully thus far, building on the infrastructure of a powerful financial services company.Yet the issues inherent in such a business model are clear, namely the issue of scalability: As an expertise-intensive business model, the ability to scale is fundamentally limited. Thus far, it has contributed to Mastercard's bottom line, but whether it can do so over the next several years remains to be seen. Leveraging a degree of financial knowledge that newcomers to the mobile payments world, such as Stripe, could keep Mastercard at the forefront of an industry that faces significant disruption. Yet the fundamental economics of the consulting and advisory services sector is such that it may also end up producing margin contraction and greater susceptibility to cyclical market swings.Competitive pressures showingCompetition, from both incumbents such as Visa and American Express, as well as from newcomers to the mobile payments world, is set to challenge Mastercard and its market position. So far, Mastercard has fought back against encroachment via a range of strategies, such as increased rebates and incentives, as well as amped up loyalty programs, to keep customers sweet and attract new MasterCard holders.Rebates could end up representing a third of revenues in 2017. If that trend continues, top-line revenue growth might prove too little to cover the giveaways. The mounting pressure to increase rebates and other incentives is indicative of a highly competitive business. Yet Mastercard can afford such tactics at present thanks to strong earnings growth and expansion in new markets. If it can use sweeteners to retain users and grow market share, it could yet starve out competitors trying to muscle in on its turf.The verdictBalancing growing earnings in core and new businesses against mounting competitive pressures of unknowable influence (over the long term, anyway), it is difficult to recommend Mastercard as a strong buy like so many of the Wall Street shops have done. The price-earnings ratio of nearly 35 and year-to-date share price appreciation of nearly 40% make my value instincts worry.Overall, while a solid company that probably has better than average growth potential (despite competitive pressures), the price is a bit too steep to recommend jumping in. If there is some pullback - more than the recent little dip certainly - then it might be worth a flutter. For now, there are better opportunities out there.Disclosure: I/We own none of the stocks mentioned in this article.This article first appeared on GuruFocus .","An impressive growth machineFinancial performance remains a highlight for Mastercard.Every time someone swipes one of the 2.4 billion MasterCard and Maestro cards somewhere in the world, Mastercard gets its transaction fee.With solid earnings and continuing market growth, Mastercard looks poised to continue its streak of financial success into 2018.If that trend continues, top-line revenue growth might prove too little to cover the giveaways.Yet Mastercard can afford such tactics at present thanks to strong earnings growth and expansion in new markets.","['market', 'master', 'world', 'financial', 'billion', 'revenue', 'company', 'quarter', 'growth', 'performance', 'competition', 'mastercard']",,,[],2017-12-08 04:59:08-05:00,https://www.nasdaq.com/article/can-mastercard-master-the-competition-cm889319,,,,

Mastercard Beats Out Q4 Wall Street Estimates,"Absent the same impact U.S. tax laws had on other firms recently reporting results, Mastercard put up numbers Thursday (Feb. 1) that topped expectations. Those figures came on the heels of increased spending by the firm‰Ûªs cardholders both in the U.S. and abroad, the company reported during a conference call with analysts.Fourth quarter sales were up 20 percent from last year to $3.3 billion, while consensus stood at $3.26 billion. Excluding the aforementioned tax impact, earnings per share came in at $1.14, two pennies better than Wall Street expectations.Cross-border volume was up double digits as cardholders spent money beyond the borders of their home territories, and Mastercard said fees tied to those transactions were up 17 percent from last year. In addition, the number of switched transactions was up 17 percent to 16.7 billion, and gross dollar volume grew 13 percent.The company also counted 2.4 billion Mastercard and Maestro-branded cards issued globally as of year-end.According to Mastercard CEO Ajay Banga, tax reform might be a benefit for spending, as businesses may invest more and consumers will have more disposable income. As for its own tax savings, the company will use at least part of the money to boost financial inclusion.Looking ahead, Mastercard‰Ûªs net revenue growth will be in the higher end of low double digits.Unemployment remains low in the U.S., Banga said, and consumer confidence remains healthy. Holiday sales were solid, though year-over-year growth in the latest quarter was a bit slower than that seen in 2017.In Europe, Germany and France are helping to drive some mild growth, while a slowing environment in the U.K. reflects continued concern and impact tied to Brexit over the medium and long terms. In Latin America, he continued, ‰ÛÏWe are cautiously optimistic that economic growth in that region in 2018 will be similar to 2017.‰ÛùAs for Vocalink, Banga focused on the company‰Ûªs image-based clearing system, which launched corporate fraud alert products with Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) as the first customer.Issuers have been expanded to 1,200 issuers in 46 markets, up from 21 markets to begin the year. Tokenized transaction growth is up 500 percent, and Masterpass saw increased adoption in the grocery category, Banga added.Turning to where tax savings might be spent, the executive stated Mastercard ‰ÛÏwill absolutely accelerate investments ‰ÛÓ both in an organic and inorganic basis ‰ÛÓ in areas that are aligned with our business strategy, digital infrastructure of fast ACH [and] data analytics.‰ÛùCFO Martina Hund-Mejean noted that worldwide gross dollar volume was up 13 percent, with double-digit growth in all regions outside the U.S. Without the U.S., volume growth was up 15 percent, a 2 percent increase from last year‰Ûªs quarter, and that growth was spearheaded by Europe and Asia.Rebates and incentives saw a 23 percent increase, Hund-Mejean noted, with a reflection of higher volumes. She also commented on cryptocurrencies.‰ÛÏWith the recent interest in and the price volatility of cryptocurrencies, we have seen an increase in this activity,‰Ûù Hund-Mejean noted. ‰ÛÏJust to be clear, we do not switch or settled cryptocurrency transactions over our network. Our plans do not assume this type of activity will continue, as we have no line of sight as to how cardholders will view cryptocurrencies in the future, and given that we‰Ûªve already seen some declines in our recent weekly trends.‰ÛùDuring the question and answer session with analysts, Hund-Mejean stated the firm is seeing an uptake in Maestro-branded cards being converted into standard Mastercard debit cards in Europe and other geographies. Speaking generally about overall volumes, cross-border volumes are up 22 percent so far in 2018, and volume outside of the U.S. appears to be ‰ÛÏpicking up.‰ÛùOne international item of note: Amid weakening economic and political conditions, Hund-Mejean said Mastercard is excluding operations tied to Venezuela from its financial results going forward.According to Banga, Europe is seeing ‰ÛÏlarge growth across the region on merchant acceptance‰Û_that used to prefer to take either local payment systems only, or cash and goods.‰Ûù In terms of the recently enacted PSD2, some of the tax savings will be funneled toward ‰ÛÏfocusing on the opportunity with fast ACH‰Ûù and on Vocalink efforts in the region.The lines of questioning turned toward eBay and the impending end of its relationship with PayPal.‰ÛÏI‰Ûªm pretty certain that all of you thought about one day that relationship will come up for reassessment, and it‰Ûªs come up for reassessment and eBay has chosen what it wants to do‰Û_‰Ûù Banga said. ‰ÛÏI think we are a key beneficiary of that because as you know, we‰Ûªve got a great partnership with PayPal, which includes all their co-branded cards and their corporate cards and all the understanding and how their wallet is used, including visibility of the brand and the non-steering towards ACH and the data flow.‰ÛùIn terms of general strategies surrounding digital payments, the executive had further comments.‰ÛÏYou‰Ûªll find us doing all kinds of things with banks, with merchants‰Û_‰Ûù Banga noted. ‰ÛÏWe‰Ûªre going to keep investing and aligning the developer community to access our capabilities at digital,‰Ûù eyeing the ‰ÛÏsimplest form of [application program interfaces (APIs)] and [software development kits (SDKs)] so we can get embedded in more and more locations‰Û_ PayPal, eBay [and] other issues will come and go, [and] we are doing what we need to do.‰Ûù","The company also counted 2.4 billion Mastercard and Maestro-branded cards issued globally as of year-end.According to Mastercard CEO Ajay Banga, tax reform might be a benefit for spending, as businesses may invest more and consumers will have more disposable income.Rebates and incentives saw a 23 percent increase, Hund-Mejean noted, with a reflection of higher volumes.‰ÛÏWith the recent interest in and the price volatility of cryptocurrencies, we have seen an increase in this activity,‰Ûù Hund-Mejean noted.‰ÛÏYou‰Ûªll find us doing all kinds of things with banks, with merchants‰Û_‰Ûù Banga noted.","['europe', 'street', 'mastercard', 'banga', 'hundmejean', 'billion', 'wall', 'noted', 'cards', 'beats', 'growth', 'tax', 'volume', 'estimates', 'q4']",,,[],2018-02-02 04:02:20+00:00,https://www.pymnts.com/earnings/2018/mastercard-earnings-q4/,,,,

Batteriet er svÌ_rt lite, men det skal lÌüse et stort problem.Fjerner sperreDe nye kortene med Idex sine fingeravlesere skal kunne brukes uten at man slÌ´r inn noen pinkode, omtrent som man nÌ´ Ì´pner mobiltelefoner med tommelen. Men Idex og Mastercard har en ekstra utfordring som man ikke har pÌ´ mobil.‰ÛÒ PÌ´ en mobiltelefon registrerer man jo fingeravtrykket nÌ´r man fÌ´r telefonen, men i et kredittkort med fingeravtrykkssensor har man ikke noe batteri, sier Knudsen.Les ogsÌ´: Her er fremtidens betalingsmetoderDen nye lÌüsningen skal gi kortet nok strÌüm til Ì´ registrere brukerens fingeravtrykk. Uten dette kunne kundene blitt nÌüdt til Ì´ besÌüke en bank for Ì´ registrere fingeravtrykket, og dette kunne blitt en stor hindring. Knudsen sier dette har vÌ_rt en viktig utfordring, som mÌ´tte lÌüses.‰ÛÒ Mastercard skriver at dette er en viktig brikke for utrulling av kortet og det mener vi ogsÌ´. Hele poenget er at korene skal vÌ_re enklere Ì´ bruke og sikrere, og det er ikke sÌ´ praktisk hvis du mÌ´ gÌ´ i en bank for Ì´ ta det i bruk, sier Knudsen.Billigere enn portoKnudsen ser nÌ´ for seg at denne plastlommen kan sendes i posten, gjerne separat fra kortet, omtrent slik kort og kode har vÌ_rt sendt ut i Norge.- Er det dyrt?-Nei, det koster kanskje mindre en portoen, sier Knudsen om batteriet.Knudsen sier konkurrentene er i gang med pilottesting nÌ´, men at Idex fullfÌürte slike tester med Mastercard i april i fjor. I desember startet sertifiseringen av kortene, en oppgave Mastercard er ansvarlig for. Det finnes ikke noen kort pÌ´ markedet ennÌ´, og det har vÌ_rt en lang vei Ì´ gÌ´.Lang veiAllerede i 2010 hadde selskapet som mÌ´l Ì´ fÌ´ teknologien ut i markedet til kunder, og mot slutten av Ì´ret gikk aksjekursen til himmels etter at de mottok en viktig pris. MÌ´let var klart ‰ÛÒ Ì´ fÌ´ fingeravtrykksleseren inn i alle betalingskort fra de stÌürste utstederne.‰ÛÒ Det er ingen hemmelighet at vi ikke har hatt sÌ´ store inntekter, men vi satser pÌ´ betalingskort og det mener vi vÌ´r teknologi er spesielt godt egnet for, sier Knudsen.Hun sier deres avleser kan lages i bÌüyelig plast, mens konkurrentene har stÌürre deler av brikkene i stivt materiale.NÌ´ sikter selskapet mot at de fÌürste sluttkundene skal ha kortene i andre halvdel av 2018.‰ÛÒ NÌ´r hÌ´per dere millionene begynner Ì´ rulle inn?‰ÛÒ Det er vi forsiktig med Ì´ si. Vi gir ikke noe guiding pÌ´ tid eller volum. Vi er overbevist om at det kommer til Ì´ skje men vet ikke nÌ´r det tar av eller hvor store de fÌürste volumene vil bli, sier hun.Les ogsÌ´: Bygger ut Vipps med tre nye tjenesterHun forteller at kortene som nÌ´ sertifiseres ikke er kontaktlÌüse, de krever at man setter dem inn i en avleser. Men hun sier selskapet skal i gang med pilottesting av kontaktlÌüse kort, og regner med at dette vil gÌ´ enklere og raskere.‰ÛÒ Det er ny teknologi, og det er hele tiden nye utfordringer man mÌ´ gjennom, men vi regner med det gÌ´r raskere nÌ´, ettersom vi allerede har vÌ_rt gjennom prosessen pÌ´ kontaktbaserte kort, sier hun.(VilkÌ´r)","‰ÛÒ Dette mener bÌ´de vi og Mastercard er et gjennombrudd for Ì´ rulle ut biometriske kort globalt, sier Charlotte Knudsen, direktÌür for investorrelasjoner og kommunikasjon i Idex.Men Idex og Mastercard har en ekstra utfordring som man ikke har pÌ´ mobil.‰ÛÒ Mastercard skriver at dette er en viktig brikke for utrulling av kortet og det mener vi ogsÌ´.‰ÛÒ Det er ingen hemmelighet at vi ikke har hatt sÌ´ store inntekter, men vi satser pÌ´ betalingskort og det mener vi vÌ´r teknologi er spesielt godt egnet for, sier Knudsen.‰ÛÒ Det er vi forsiktig med Ì´ si.","['pÌ´', 'og', 'mener', 'det', 'en', 'med', 'sier', 'globalt', 'har', 'ut', 'vi', 'rulle', 'er', 'Ì´', 'mastercard', 'et', 'gjennombrudd']",,,[],5/2/18 0:00,https://www.dn.no/nyheter/2018/05/02/1036/Finans/-dette-mener-bade-vi-og-mastercard-er-et-gjennombrudd-for-a-rulle-ut-globalt,,,,

Holiday cheer lifts Mastercard's profit above Street,"(Reuters) - Mastercard Inc‰Ûªs (MA.N) quarterly profit topped estimates on Thursday, boosted by a busy holiday shopping period that saw more people swiping credit and debit cards for larger sums.Mastercard Inc. credit cards are displayed in this picture illustration taken December 8, 2017. REUTERS/Benoit Tessier/IllustrationThe company‰Ûªs shares rose 4.4 percent to an all-time of $176.52.Growth in the U.S. economy over the last quarter also helped the world‰Ûªs No. 2 payments network, which, like bigger rival Visa Inc (V.N) largely banks on the health of the economy and customers‰Ûª willingness to loosen purse strings in order to generate revenue from credit- and debit-card transactions.U.S. consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of the country‰Ûªs economic activity, accelerated at a 3.8 percent annualized rate in the fourth quarter, the fastest in three years, as household incomes continued inching up.Outside the United States too, Mastercard has a strong presence. Cross-border volumes - the value of transactions made by overseas cardholders - rose 22.4 percent on a U.S. dollar-converted basis in the fourth quarter.Europe, and the Asia Pacific, Middle East and Africa (APMEA) region accounted for majority of the cross-border volumes, Chief Financial Officer Martina Hund-Mejean said.Around 1 percent point growth in overseas volumes came from ‰ÛÏcardholders funding accounts and cryptocurrency exchanges, which was then used to purchase digital currencies‰Ûù, Hund-Mejean said on a post-earnings call with analysts.Gross dollar volume - the value of transactions processed - was the highest in the Asia Pacific, Middle East and Africa region, and superseded that in the United States.In APMEA, the value of transactions processed came in at $435 billion, versus $423 billion in the United States alone.‰ÛÏPayment volumes (for Mastercard) will stay healthy, we think, and a more sustained global economic recovery could eventually lead to an acceleration of spending and further revenue growth,‰Ûù CFRA analyst Scott Kessler wrote in a note.Net income fell 76 percent to $227 million, or 21 cents per share, in the quarter ended Dec. 31, as the company booked $981 million in charges, primarily due to the U.S. tax reform. (mstr.cd/2nwXaUZ)Excluding items, Mastercard earned $1.14 per share, beating the average analyst estimate of $1.12, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.The company‰Ûªs net revenue jumped 20.2 percent to $3.31 billion.","(Reuters) - Mastercard Inc‰Ûªs (MA.N) quarterly profit topped estimates on Thursday, boosted by a busy holiday shopping period that saw more people swiping credit and debit cards for larger sums.Mastercard Inc. credit cards are displayed in this picture illustration taken December 8, 2017.Outside the United States too, Mastercard has a strong presence.Cross-border volumes - the value of transactions made by overseas cardholders - rose 22.4 percent on a U.S. dollar-converted basis in the fourth quarter.In APMEA, the value of transactions processed came in at $435 billion, versus $423 billion in the United States alone.","['street', 'credit', 'cheer', 'holiday', 'united', 'lifts', 'volumes', 'transactions', 'billion', 'states', 'mastercards', 'profit', 'quarter', 'revenue', 'mastercard', 'value']",,,['Aparajita Saxena'],2018-02-01 17:26:09+00:00,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mastercard-results/holiday-cheer-lifts-mastercards-profit-above-street-idUSKBN1FL5AL,,,,
Mastercard Patents Blockchain Tech For Instant Payments,"Mastercard has recently filed a patent for instantaneous payments using Blockchain technology. The patent appeared in the US Patent and Trademark data system dated the 9th of this month.The patent makes clear that Mastercard intends to use Blockchain technology to create a system where merchants can receive guaranteed instantaneous payment rather than waiting for multiple days before credit card transactions can be verified and then paid by card issuers. According to the filing:‰ÛÏThus, there is a need for a technical solution where a payment transaction can be guaranteed in a manner that is readily verifiable by an acquiring financial institution and/or merchant‰Û_By enabling the use of the guarantee with multiple payment instruments and transaction types, the guarantee may be used in more situations with a higher convenience to both consumers and merchants, which may result in merchants receiving instantaneous, guaranteed payment while maintaining a high level of consumer convenience.‰ÛùPro Blockchain, anti-BitcoinMastercard has already shown a strong interest in the technology, filing previous patents and announcing other Blockchain related solutions. However, the company has also been ardently opposed to Bitcoin, with the CEO even making disparaging remarks against the cryptocurrency.This most recent announcement only highlights the level of intensely negative feelings toward Bitcoin among institutionalized finance departments, all while embracing the technology it is built on.","Mastercard has recently filed a patent for instantaneous payments using Blockchain technology.The patent appeared in the US Patent and Trademark data system dated the 9th of this month.The patent makes clear that Mastercard intends to use Blockchain technology to create a system where merchants can receive guaranteed instantaneous payment rather than waiting for multiple days before credit card transactions can be verified and then paid by card issuers.However, the company has also been ardently opposed to Bitcoin, with the CEO even making disparaging remarks against the cryptocurrency.This most recent announcement only highlights the level of intensely negative feelings toward Bitcoin among institutionalized finance departments, all while embracing the technology it is built on.","['instantaneous', 'transaction', 'instant', 'blockchain', 'patent', 'payments', 'technology', 'patents', 'system', 'guaranteed', 'mastercard', 'multiple', 'tech', 'merchants', 'payment']",,,[],2017-11-14 12:45:00+00:00,https://cointelegraph.com/news/mastercard-patents-blockchain-tech-for-instant-payments,,,,

Mastercard Wows the Market With a Record Quarter,"Mastercard Inc (NYSE: MA) stock surged more than 4 percent on Wednesday after the company reported first-quarter numbers that were well above analyst expectations. In fact, both net income and revenue were record numbers for Mastercard.Mastercard reported first-quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.41 on revenue of $3.6 billion. Both numbers came in well ahead of consensus analyst estimates of $1.25 and $3.25 billion, respectively. Revenue was up 31 percent compared to a year ago.The impressive revenue growth more than doubled the growth rate of credit card competitor Visa (V), which reported a 13 percent uptick in first-quarter revenue last month.Mastercard reported a 14 percent increase in gross dollar volume in the first quarter and a 15 percent increase in purchase volume.Operating margin declined by 4.1 percent to 51 percent. Total operating expenses increased 43 percent to $1.8 billion.In the first quarter, Mastercard repurchased $1.4 billion in stock and paid out $263 million in dividends.""We're off to a very strong start to the year, with record revenue and earnings this quarter, as we continue to execute against our strategy,"" CEO Ajay Banga says in a statement. ""We are investing in areas such as safety and security and our digital solutions to drive long-term growth with a focus on delivering simple and secure transactions across all channels.""Following the strong report, Mastercard shares initially traded above $187. If the stock opens at or near that level, it would represent a new all-time high.CFRA analyst Scott Kessler says Mastercard will continue to benefit from the secular transition from cash and check payments to electronic payments. But with the stock already up nearly 250 percent in the past three years, additional upside may be hard to come by.""MA has multiple growth avenues, including international expansion, market share gain potential, mobile payment development and prepaid,"" Kessler says. ""That said, we see rebates and incentives remaining high in the near term as merchants push for lower fees and competition grows from alternative payment technologies.""CFRA has a ""hold"" rating and $172 price target for MA stock.","Mastercard Inc (NYSE: MA) stock surged more than 4 percent on Wednesday after the company reported first-quarter numbers that were well above analyst expectations.In fact, both net income and revenue were record numbers for Mastercard.Mastercard reported first-quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.41 on revenue of $3.6 billion.Mastercard reported a 14 percent increase in gross dollar volume in the first quarter and a 15 percent increase in purchase volume.In the first quarter, Mastercard repurchased $1.4 billion in stock and paid out $263 million in dividends.","['firstquarter', 'market', 'record', 'stock', 'wows', 'billion', 'quarter', 'growth', 'analyst', 'reported', 'revenue', 'numbers', 'mastercard']",,,[],5/2/18 0:00,https://money.usnews.com/investing/stock-market-news/articles/2018-05-02/mastercard-inc-ma-stock,,,,

Mastercard and IFC update partnership to enhance a risk-sharing facility for payments ‰ÛÒ IBS Intelligence,"Mastercard and IFC, a member of the World Bank Group, today bolstered their partnership to drive financial inclusion, updating a $250 million global risk-sharing facility to expand access to electronic payments in emerging markets. Electronic payments help underserved people and small businesses more fully participate in the formal economy. Yet, financial institutions in emerging markets often have difficulty covering their transaction settlement obligations, making it harder to rapidly scale financial services where they are needed most.Updating an agreement originally signed in 2015, the revised agreement between IFC and Mastercard helps financial institutions in developing countries participate in the Mastercard network more effectively through a program in which IFC will guarantee up to 100 percent of the settlement risk. The new agreement will support a major expansion of the program to more participating banks and financial institutions.Stephanie von Friedeburg, IFC chief operating officer said, ‰ÛÏThis partnership will help bring modern financial services to underserved people around the world. It allows us to pool our capabilities in risk management and financial technologies, and to leverage our global network of financial institutions to deliver financial inclusion.‰ÛùWith the revised agreement, Mastercard will extend its efforts to identify, develop and implement programs with participating financial institutions. This will improve access to electronic payments for millions of people in emerging markets. The company will also continue to support a separate 2016 agreement with IFC to increase acceptance of electronic payments among small businesses and micro entrepreneurs in the same markets.‰ÛÏTrue inclusion is not something any one entity can deliver on its own,‰Ûù said Michael Froman, vice chairman and president, strategic growth at Mastercard. ‰ÛÏIt‰Ûªs partnerships like this, combined with technology and know-how, that are truly driving greater inclusion in emerging markets. The programs the facility is developing around the world are vital to bringing people and communities into the financial system and on a path to prosperity.‰ÛùMastercard‰Ûªs broader work with the World Bank Group is helping to increase universal financial access by 2020. In 2015, the company committed to reach 500 million people previously excluded from financial services within five years. Today, the company has connected more than 330 million people around the world through programs like the Mastercard-IFC public-private partnership, with more to come.","Mastercard and IFC, a member of the World Bank Group, today bolstered their partnership to drive financial inclusion, updating a $250 million global risk-sharing facility to expand access to electronic payments in emerging markets.Electronic payments help underserved people and small businesses more fully participate in the formal economy.Yet, financial institutions in emerging markets often have difficulty covering their transaction settlement obligations, making it harder to rapidly scale financial services where they are needed most.This will improve access to electronic payments for millions of people in emerging markets.‰ÛÏIt‰Ûªs partnerships like this, combined with technology and know-how, that are truly driving greater inclusion in emerging markets.","['electronic', 'update', 'world', 'payments', 'financial', 'ifc', 'partnership', 'intelligence', 'risksharing', 'ibs', 'markets', 'institutions', 'facility', 'enhance', 'emerging', 'mastercard', 'agreement']",,,"['Henry Vilar', 'Henry Is Junior Reporter At Ibs Intelligence', 'Follow Him On']",2018-04-27 10:48:16+01:00,https://ibsintelligence.com/ibs-journal/mastercard-and-ifc-update-partnership-to-enhance-a-risk-sharing-facility-for-payments/,,,,
MasterCard Is Open Only To State-Issued Cryptocurrencies,"As the Financial Times reported today, the co-president of Asia-Pacific business of Mastercard revealed that the firm is considering the idea of using virtual currencies in the future, but only those that are issued by national central banks.Ari Sarker, who is the Senior MasterCard executive said that if governments seek to create national virtual currency they would be happy to look at those in a more favorable way (in comparison to cryptocurrencies in general).Company‰Ûªs CEO, Ajay Banga had also stated last fall that MasterCard would find a way to be in the game for digital currencies created by governments while labeling all other digital currencies without government backing as junk.Cryptocurrencies that are issued by governments have been discussed in some countries around the world, but so far the centralized crypto project has not been realized by the majority. The best example of a successfully-issued state cryptocurrency is Venezuela‰Ûªs Petro that was recently released under a cloud of controversy.Further, Sarker revealed that MasterCard is currently running a Bitcoin pilot program in Singapore and Japan that would allow Bitcoin holders to cash out onto a MasterCard. He added that the pilot involves both AML and KYC policies, highlighting that they are not operating Bitcoin trading through the Mastercard network as they are fully aware of the reputational risk.The Financial Times describes that both Visa and MasterCard had reclassified Bitcoin purchases as cash transactions, a move with added fees for their cryptocurrency customers.In November of last year, Mastercard had filed a patent for instantaneous payments using Blockchain. Also, a MasterCard spokesperson claims that MasterCard Labs has filed for more than 30 patents related to cryptocurrency and blockchain technology.Finally, Sarker added that MasterCard is running pilot programs in Australia and Singapore regarding a contactless payment transport system.Are the banks negative towards cryptocurrency purchases using credit cards?A wave of banks banned cryptocurrency purchases with credit cards recently, including Bank of America in the US, Citigroup, Lloyd‰Ûªs Banking, and J.P.

See Which Of The Latest 13F Filers Holds Mastercard,"At Holdings Channel , we have reviewed the latest batch of the 21 most recent 13F filings for the 03/31/2018 reporting period, and noticed that Mastercard Inc (Symbol: MA) was held by 15 of these funds. When hedge fund managers appear to be thinking alike, we find it is a good idea to take a closer look.Before we proceed, it is important to point out that 13F filings do not tell the whole story, because these funds are only required to disclose their long positions with the SEC, but are not required to disclose their short positions. A fund making a bearish bet against a stock by shorting calls, for example, might also be long some amount of stock as they trade around their overall bearish position. This long component could show up in a 13F filing and everyone might assume the fund is bullish, but this tells only part of the story because the bearish/short side of the position is not seen .Having given that caveat, we believe that looking at groups of 13F filings can be revealing, especially when comparing one holding period to another. Below, let's take a look at the change in MA positions, for this latest batch of 13F filers:In terms of shares owned, we count 2 of the above funds having increased existing MA positions from 12/31/2017 to 03/31/2018, with 10 having decreased their positions and 2 new positions.Looking beyond these particular funds in this one batch of most recent filers, we tallied up the MA share count in the aggregate among all of the funds which held MA at the 03/31/2018 reporting period (out of the 1,137 we looked at in total). We then compared that number to the sum total of MA shares those same funds held back at the 12/31/2017 period, to see how the aggregate share count held by hedge funds has moved for MA. We found that between these two periods, funds reduced their holdings by 1,996,878 shares in the aggregate, from 53,098,343 down to 51,101,465 for a share count decline of approximately -3.76%. The overall top three funds holding MA on 03/31/2018 were:We'll keep following the latest 13F filings by hedge fund managers and bring you interesting stories derived from a look at the aggregate information across groups of managers between filing periods. While looking at individual 13F filings can sometimes be misleading due to the long-only nature of the information, the sum total across groups of funds from one reporting period to another can be a lot more revealing and relevant, providing interesting stock ideas that merit further research, like Mastercard Inc (Symbol: MA).10 S&P 500 Components Hedge Funds Are Buying åÈ","At Holdings Channel , we have reviewed the latest batch of the 21 most recent 13F filings for the 03/31/2018 reporting period, and noticed that Mastercard Inc (Symbol: MA) was held by 15 of these funds.When hedge fund managers appear to be thinking alike, we find it is a good idea to take a closer look.Having given that caveat, we believe that looking at groups of 13F filings can be revealing, especially when comparing one holding period to another.The overall top three funds holding MA on 03/31/2018 were:We'll keep following the latest 13F filings by hedge fund managers and bring you interesting stories derived from a look at the aggregate information across groups of managers between filing periods.10 S&P 500 Components Hedge Funds Are Buying åÈ","['count', 'held', 'funds', 'latest', 'period', 'fund', 'filers', 'hedge', 'ma', '13f', 'filings', 'mastercard', 'positions', 'holds']",,,['Bnk Invest'],2018-05-01 10:05:19-05:00,https://www.nasdaq.com/article/see-which-of-the-latest-13f-filers-holds-mastercard-cm956228,,,,
